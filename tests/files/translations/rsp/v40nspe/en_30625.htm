<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This work provides a literature review of Policy, Planning and
Health Management between 1974 and 2005. Information is presented
from previous research and publications, incorporating the
production contained within the LILACS database from the last
five years. The emergence of studies in these sub-themes is
described in an attempt to associate them with political
circumstances, with particular emphasis on: the Sanitary Reform
Process, the construction of the National Health System and the
reorientation of health practices. The particularities of the
production in this field are discussed and the need for
historical and epistemological work in Brazil is emphasized. The
practical challenges impose techno-scientific expertise and,
primarily, socio-political militancy on individual and collective
subjects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conducting a review of Policy, Planning and Health Management
(PP&amp;HM) affords an excellent opportunity to reflect not only
on its theoretical-conceptual development, but, primarily, to
systematize tendencies in its production of publications and
empirical investigations. Due to the constitutive link between
the composition in the field of public health, the movement for
the democratization of health and the proposal for Brazilian
Sanitary Reform (BSR), the thematic area of PP&amp;HM must be
analyzed within such a historical perspective. Thus, it was by
examining the relationship between scientific production and
political circumstances to reconcile new relationships between
the State and society that Donn&acirc;ngelo<sup>7</sup> (1983)
elaborated a pioneering study on collective health research in
Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not to suggest that before the 1970s there had not
existed production within this thematic area. The theses defended
in the <i>Faculdade de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> of the
<i>Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> and in the <i>Escola
Nacional de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>, the articles
published in the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>,
the critical texts of Carlos Gentile de Mello and M&aacute;rio
Magalh&atilde;es da Silveira (among others), and the reports of
experiences and reflections divulged in the old <i>Revista do
Servi&ccedil;o Especial de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>, all
attest to the interest of those Brazilians involved in the
sanitary field to studies of health services. Books were also
published, including "Fundamentos da Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o
Sanit&aacute;ria" (Fundamentals of Sanitary
Administration)<sup>13</sup> by Dr. Bichat de Almeida
Rodrigues.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This initial production was centered on sanitary
administration and included, subsequently, health programming.
Planning and policy were themes less covered and were limited to
questions of budget, organization and sanitary legislation. Along
with the critique of social medicine during the early 1970s and
the development of social health sciences, it was possible for
the emergent collective health to reconstitute the PP&amp;HM in
Brazil. In this aspect, the publication "Medicina e Sociedade"
(<i>Medicine and Society</i>), of Donn&acirc;ngelo,<sup>6</sup>
is a landmark for its reconstitution. In studying the
relationships between the State and medical assistance,
Donn&acirc;ngelo broke away from the dominant lines of
interpreting government intervention in health, be it through the
tendency to rationalize or through the guarantee of the right to
health. In searching the social class dynamic for an explanation
for State action, a perspective arose for the development of
studies in health policy, as well as alternative forms of
thinking about institutions and, consequently, of planning and
management.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hence, the present article uses, as an initial historical
reference for the analysis of scientific production in PP&amp;HM,
the circumstances that favored: the emergence of collective
health, the creation of the <i>Centro Brasileiro de Estudos de
Sa&uacute;de</i> (Cebes - Brazilian Center for Health Studies) in
1976, the development of postgraduate courses, the founding of
the <i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de
P&oacute;s-gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o em Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i>
(Abrasco - Brazilian Association of Collective Health
Postgraduate Programs) in 1979, and the strengthening of the
so-called sanitary movement. An attempt was made to characterize
the development of this field, seeking to identify the trends
that marked the production of knowledge in PP&amp;HM, whilst
considering changes in political and academic circumstances
throughout this period.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the current
knowledge of PP&amp;HM in the field of collective health in
Brazil between 1974 and 2005, seeking to contextualize the
production and dissemination of knowledge during distinct
periods. However, an evaluation of quantitative data was not
attempted, nor was an exhaustive survey of the scientific
production, as in previous works,<sup>2,3,9,16</sup> since this
was based on research of the <i>Literatura Latino-Americana e do
Caribe em Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de</i> (LILACS -
Latin-American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences)
bibliographic database in the period from 2001 to 2005.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>HEALTH POLICY</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Health policy</i> is understood to be the social response
(in action or omission) of an organization (such as the State) in
the face of the health conditions of individuals and populations,
and their determinants as well as its relation to production,
distribution, management and regulation of goods and services
that affect human health and the environment. Health policy
covers questions relating to <i>power</i> in health
(<i>Politics</i>), as well as those that encompass the
establishment of <i>directives, plans</i> and <i>programs</i> of
health (<i>Policy</i>). Thus, the word <i>policy</i>, as is
explicit in the Portuguese language, expresses both the
dimensions of power and the directives. Despite this, as an
academic area, health policy addresses the relations of power in
the conformation of the agenda, and in the formulation, conduct,
implementation and evaluation of policies.<sup>11</sup> Thus,
<i>health policy</i> involves studies on the role of the State,
the relationship between the State and society, the reactions to
health conditions and their determinants by the population,
through proposals and priorities for public action. It also
includes the study of its relationship to economic and social
policies, social control, health economy and
financing.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the origins of health policy research in Brazil are found
theses and journals that stimulated and supported debates on the
performance of the nascent sanitary movement, as the nature of
this movement and the challenges of the Sanitary Reform became
objects of academic studies that established bridges with
society.<sup>8</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the development of the Cebes activities and with the
organization of Abrasco, such articulations became more
integrated. The text "Pelo Direito Universal &agrave;
Sa&uacute;de" (For the Universal Right to Health),<sup>1</sup>
released during the 8th National Conference on Health, embodies
this nature by the importance that it held during that historical
event. However, this political visibility obscured efforts to
consolidate health policy as an academic discipline, directed
toward scientific production and subject to theoretical and
methodological rigor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such consolidation came about with the production of
dissertations and postgraduate theses and of the first surveys
and systematic publications during the second half of the
1990s.<sup>2,16</sup> Thus, not only did broader studies on the
State and public policies become more visible, but research was
also focused on the implementation of policies in
organizations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an investigation of the database of theses from the
<i>Coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o de Aperfei&ccedil;oamento de Pessoal
de N&iacute;vel Superior</i> (Capes - Coordination for the
Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) on health policy
between 1993 and 1998, Ayres<sup>3</sup> (2000) confirmed that
the studies concentrated on the following topics: a) emergency
processes, formulation and implementation of policies
(constitution of the public agenda); b) dynamic and performance
of the social actors (mobilization/demobilization); c)
socio-historical context; d) life cycle of each policy (<i>policy
cycle</i>); e) repercussions and recurring policy patterns; f)
and questions that become objects of intervention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Levcovitz et al<sup>9</sup> (2003) considered in addition to
theses and dissertations, books, journal articles (Brazilian and
international), conferences and Brazilian meetings on health. The
authors analyzed the political debate and the knowledge produced
in PP&amp;HM and adopted a timeline for the trends in Brazilian
health policies divided into five stages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first (1974-1979) was characterized by the investigation
of the economic, political and social determinants of the
conformation of health systems and the formulation of
alternatives. Notable among the themes covered are: the State and
health policy; the National Health System; the welfare system;
diagnosis of social and health conditions; and health
programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second (1980-1986) 
  involved the dissemination of proposals for reform and socio-political cohesion. 
  During this phase, themes appeared such as: increased coverage, history of psychiatry, 
  medical practice, assistance model &#150; primary health care, reform principles, 
  social movements, strategic planning, services diagnosis and specific programs 
  (child, woman, and others).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third phase (1987-1990) was characterized by the
judicial/legal arrangement of principles and directives of the
reform project. The following themes appeared in this phase:
citizenship, epidemiological patterns and inequalities,
financing, access and demand for services, decentralization, and
others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fourth phase (1991-1998) sought to define the role of each
sphere of government and the elaboration of instruments for this
relationship, with the production of knowledge directed toward
the following aspects: adjustment of State reform,
"municipalization", the <i>Programa Sa&uacute;de da
Fam&iacute;lia</i> (PSF - Family Heath Program), public-private
relations, promotion of health, districting/local health systems,
social security, social control, assistance models, and
others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final phase (1999-2000) analyzed by the authors addressed
the regulation of financing and the organization of management
models and attention to the regionalized services network. In
this phase, scientific production concentrated upon the
adjustment of State reform, financing, social control, assistance
models and public-private relations. New themes also appeared,
including: health economy, health and the environment,
information systems, human resources management, technology and
health, the work process, and others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the purposes of classification, a sixth phase can be
included (2001-2005) to the aforementioned timeline. Even running
the risk of oversimplification, it is worth noting in this phase
the search for stability of financing (as required by the
29<sup>th</sup> constitutional amendment) and the development of
basic care, such as the expansion of the PSF<i>.</i> Scientific
production was concentrated on the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de
Sa&uacute;de</i> (SUS - National Health System) and the Sanitary
Reform, with emphasis on human resources, social control, health
information, decentralization, integrality and equity. Also
notable was the expansion of health economy, which resulted from
studies on the so-called "health maintenance organization sector
(HMOs)", financing, allocation of resources and public-private
relations. Thus, the segmentation of the health services system
in Brazil among the public health system (SUS) and the market was
quantitatively expressed in the production of the PP&amp;HM.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alongside these 
  studies there was the strong presence of research on basic health care emphasizing 
  family health. A dynamic scientific production appears on the promotion of health, 
  mental health, oral health, care models, humanization and health care. During 
  the period in question, the production of PP&amp;HM also covered: medication 
  policy and pharmaceutical assistance (emphasizing generic drugs), metropolitan 
  health, sanitary vigilance, worker health and indigenous health. Health evaluation 
  represents a theme frequently observed. General studies on the SUS and its implementation 
  were seen in studies of organization and regionalization, special programs (AIDS, 
  dengue, tuberculosis, hanseniasis, women, children, adolescents, aged and others) 
  and hospital care. However, publications on macro- and micro-regulation of assistance, 
  ethical aspects, and the health of the Black and male population are still rare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Health Planning 
  and Management</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>planning</i> analysis of scientific production in the
present article included: studies on the implementation of a
coordinated set of actions to achieve a determined objective;
studies of the strategies used to confront problems and the
mechanisms of policy implementation; theoretical and
methodological studies for the construction of plans, programs
and projects (planning in health, strategic planning and health
programming). The <i>management</i> sub-theme included studies on
the creation and utilization of means that substantiate the
principles of political organization; and included services
management studies and health systems, quality management,
strategic management, human resources management, budget and
financial management.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the timeline elaborated by the cited authors,<sup>9</sup>
the first phase (1974-1979) had as its principal characteristic
the emergence of studies on the organization of community medical
services, undertaking research on coverage and accessibility of
the population to primary care services, critical testing,
necessities of health and of services, community health
diagnoses, evaluation of programs and others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the subsequent phase (1980-1986), studies appeared on
programs for the extension of health cover that were elaborated
and implemented in the previous period, initially experimentally
and later as a strategy for institutional modernization in the
field of public health, alongside studies of programs for
education and personnel training and experiences of
assistance-instructor integration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The end of the 1980s (3<sup>rd</sup> phase) was marked by the
elaboration and implementation of proposals for reform in
management, planning and organization of services. Notable during
this period was the growing interest for
theoretical-methodological questions in the health planning and
management field. The confronting of "practical challenges" was
evidenced by academic instructors and researchers that came to be
involved in the state and municipal health secretaries. These
challenges stimulated reflections on questions relating to the
change in political-management practices in the public sphere of
the 4<sup>th</sup> phase (1991-1998) in various academic centers.
This led to a diversification of theoretical-methodological
themes and approaches, shaping various streams of thought, which
were expressed in the production of books and articles that
reflected the multidisciplinary nature of topics and approaches
in the area. Indeed, between the 1980s and 1990s, historical and
theoretical studies appeared on the conceptual and methodological
development of health planning that emphasized the unfolding
critique of the instrumental character of planning and its
articulation with the process of reorientation of health policy.
Also worth noting are reports of local experiences at the start
of the regionalization process of health services in various
Brazilian states and municipalities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In phase 5 (1999-2000), studies analyzing and evaluating
health management, in its various dimensions and levels of
complexity, gained prominence. The decentralized management of
the SUS became the background for the large set of studies on
aspects relating to planning, programming, reorganization of the
work process, health information systems, training of personnel,
monitoring practices, supervision and evaluation of health
systems and services, as well as studies on the participation and
social control of the SUS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between 2001 and 2005 (phase 6), the most obvious direction of
knowledge production in planning and management was the
substantial increase of research on the "municipalization" of
management and the expansion of basic health care. From the
second half of the 1990s, some of these themes were consolidated
in debates, such as the issues relating to the decentralized
management of the SUS, as a result of advances in the
decentralization process and the process of change in the health
care model resulting from the implementation of the PSF.
Presently, the production of information concerning hospital
administration is increasing, probably as a result of the
unfolding political-institutional circumstances in the areas of
planning and management. This area has come to include themes
critical of the process of change in the care model, such as the
reorientation of policy and management of hospital units. An
increase in studies and proposals in the areas of management
information and health communication is also evident, addressing
challenges posed to managers by the rapidly advancing
technologies that reconcile the Internet and telecommunications
with health practices.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The literature review of the material concerning scientific
production suggests that the PP&amp;HM thematic area is more
directed toward <i>intervention</i> than <i>investigation</i>,
despite recent efforts of research groups. This does not suggest
that its topics are outside the sphere of scientific rigor.
However, because they border on the immediacy of practice, these
tend to be intertwined within diverse
ideologies.<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the scientific field, symbolic power<sup>5</sup> is
expressed in recognition, prestige, titles, honors and fame but
it is also in conflict with economic and administrative power in
regards to access to resources, infrastructure and financing
mechanisms for research. The political nature of this field, and
of the process of knowledge production, must be evaluated so that
the need for objectivity in research problems and the search for
objectivity with the supposed scientific neutrality are not
confused. Thus, it is impossible to ignore values, beliefs and
ideologies, but nevertheless the theoretical-methodological rigor
in critiques and in the production of evidence should not be
discarded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, it is worth understanding <i>scientific practice</i> as
a field where knowledge and symbols are produced, in which the
understanding of information and knowledge as public goods should
be valued. Socially distributed knowledge<sup>12</sup> should
also be valued and there must be a search for "the elaboration of
health policies and actions that have better chances of being
effective and bring greater benefits for the health of the
population".<sup>4</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PP&amp;HM area, in the context of collective health,
expresses most clearly the two dimensions (knowledge and
practices) of the field, i.e. the fact that the knowledge
produced answers the problems and challenges posed to it by
subjects in their political action in determined historical
contexts. This presupposition allows for the understanding of the
direction of scientific research in this area, while the
selection of themes, the delimitation of problems, the choice of
certain theoretical-methodological approaches and even the
dissemination of results, reveal a complex web of relationships
between academia and services institutions. Such relationships
are mediated by agencies that further research and by the
collective health community. Thus, the PP&amp;HM thematic area,
founded upon social and human sciences, presents certain
specificities and has distinct implications, be they in
technological incorporation or in s<i>ocio-political
militancy.</i><sup>17</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This thematic area is significantly complicated, such that
there are moments when information is lacking for
decision-making, and others when there is sufficient knowledge
but the decisions are delayed, and others still where the
decisions are necessary even in the face of few data. An example
of this is the <i>precaution principle</i> in sanitary vigilance
and environmental health. Thus, "the process of transforming
knowledge into evidence that can sustain a decision is complex
and never totally scientific, being permeated by different
interpretations and values of existing knowledge, in the same
manner that the process of knowledge production and dissemination
is mediated by relations that are established within the
scientific community and between the scientific community and the
various sectors of societal interests".<sup>4</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regards to <i>health policy</i>, the majority of studies
undertaken until the beginning of the 1990s presented a macro
perspective, and rarely referred to health services and
institutions. Studies based on broad categories, such as State,
means of production, social training and others, did not use more
specific concepts that reflected the particular realities and
that allowed for certain interventions between the singular, the
particular and the general.<sup>10</sup> Subsequently, an
increase was evident in the area with the development of
investigations on policies, institutions and health practices, in
addition to the increase in studies evaluating
health.<sup>2,16</sup> Presently, it is notable that there is a
growing preoccupation with the evaluation of public policies.
During 2005, the following were examples of this: the seminar on
the "Effectiveness of Policies Promoting Health" (Rio de
Janeiro), the significant presence of this theme in the
3<sup>rd</sup> Brazilian Congress of Social and Human Health
Sciences of Abrasco (Florian&oacute;polis), the launching of
books and of the supplement to the <i>Cadernos de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i><sup>18</sup> dedicated to the "Investigation
and Evaluation of Health Services". It is also worth noting that
the most influential directions for <i>health policy</i> were, on
the one hand, the extension of investigation topics (health
economy, heath promotion, mental health, care and subjectivity,
among others) and, on the other, the diversification of
theoretical-methodological approaches.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The directions characteristics of <i>planning</i> and
<i>management</i> are the diversification of approaches and,
especially, the development of theoretical-conceptual studies in
technology proposals. Such proposals have spread in institutional
practice, generating many reports, case studies and evaluative
studies. The development of these proposals has pointed to the
centrality of the subject of practices,<sup>19</sup> that is, of
health managers and workers, in addition to the actual population
represented in the health councils.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the PP&amp;HM has not been the target of systematic
studies concerning its topics, methods and techniques in a
historical and epistemological perspective.<sup>14</sup> The
interface between theory and practice, generated by the
epistemological critique and by experimentation with methods and
techniques, marks the singularity of this area. This is
characterized by the search for "technological development" that
mediates the concepts, methods and instruments with the action of
concrete subjects in the area of health organizations, addressing
intervention on problems, necessities and political demands on
health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, some theoretical contributions<sup>15,17</sup> already
available could constitute a starting point for more detailed
historic and epistemological work in PP&amp;HM. Still, it is the
challenges of practice, particularly in underdeveloped, dependent
and peripheral capitalist countries, that impose socio-political
militancy and techno-scientific ability on their subjects,
individuals and collectives.</font></p>
