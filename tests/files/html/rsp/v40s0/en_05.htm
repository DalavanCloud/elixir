<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study aimed at identifying human rights' status and
situation, as expressed in the United Nations General Assembly
Special Session on HIV/AIDS, of children and adolescents living
with HIV/AIDS, non-orphans and orphans affected by AIDS, based on
local and international literature review. The main study
findings did not allow to accurately estimating those children
and adolescents living with HIV and non-orphans affected by
HIV/AIDS but data was available on those living with AIDS and
orphans. The limitations and possibilities of these estimates
obtained from surveillance systems, mathematical models and
surveys are discussed. Though studies in literature are still
quite scarce, there is indication of compromise of several rights
such as health, education, housing, nutrition, nondiscrimination,
and physical and mental integrity. Brazil still needs to advance
to meet further needs of those orphaned and vulnerable children.
Its response so far has been limited to providing health care to
those children and adolescents living with HIV/AIDS, preventing
mother-to-child HIV transmission and financing the implementation
and maintenance of support homes (shelters according to Child and
Adolescent Bill of Rights) for those infected and affected by
HIV/AIDS, either orphans or not. These actions are not enough to
ensure a supportive environment for children and adolescents
orphaned, infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. It is proposed ways
for Brazil to develop and improve databases to respond to these
challenges.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AIDS epidemic 
  has an impact on the quality of life of children and adolescents who can suffer 
  successive losses and be deprived of their parents, occasionally of their relatives, 
  and of their own health. AIDS orphans have increased risk of malnutrition when 
  compared to those children living with their parents, and they can be stigmatized 
  and discriminated because of their or their parents' HIV status, among other 
  unfavorable events.<sup>6,7,11,14,15,</sup><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for June 2005, 371,827 AIDS cases have been reported in
Brazil according to the National Program for STD/AIDS. AIDS cases
and deaths still constitute serious social and health urgency as,
since the beginning of the epidemic, about one in every two
affected people (46.2%) died.<sup>4</sup> A household survey
conducted in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil, found in the
population studied that, of every 10 people who died between 1998
and 2002, 8.8 were orphans.<sup>2</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study carried 
  out in the cities of S&atilde;o Paulo and Santos among adolescents living with 
  HIV/AIDS, some of them AIDS orphans, reported that, because of fear of stigma 
  and discrimination, they put off knowing their HIV status and disclosing it 
  to other people. These factors have an impact on their access to healthcare 
  and on other spheres of their emotional, sexual, social, and educational lives, 
  increasing their isolation and vulnerability to AIDS and violating other human 
  rights<sup>1</sup> as well. Other studies in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo showed 
  AIDS orphans, especially those living with HIV, have to live with several restrictions 
  of their rights to health, education, nutrition, privacy, sexuality, and reproduction.<a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  These all constitute violations of the rights established by Article 92 of the 
  Child and Adolescent Bill of Rights.<sup>3</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations 
  has issued, in 2001, during the United Nations General Assembly Special Session 
  on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS), a Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS defining targets 
  and indicators for implementing national programs and establishing systematic 
  evaluation and monitoring of HIV/AIDS epidemic.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  The UNGASS Declaration includes a special section on children and adolescents 
  orphaned and those vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. Brazil has endorsed the UNGASS Declaration 
  that same year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global human rights 
  documents need to be examined as to whom are the <i>subjects of rights</i> they 
  are referring to. Based on the definition of these subjects there will be drawn 
  a set of rights and obligations for their relationship with the State and other 
  social actors. It is understood that the UNGASS Declaration referred to any 
  child and adolescent aged between zero and 18 years, in the terms of the UN 
  Convention on the Rights of the Child,<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
  who has been affected, directly or indirectly through their parents or caretakers, 
  by the epidemic at any of its stages: infection, disease, or death. According 
  to UNGASS terminology, children and adolescents were grouped as: (1) <i>those 
  living with HIV/AIDS</i> (infected or diseased), orphaned or not; (2) <i>affected 
  non-orphans</i> (those living with and relying on adults, parents or caretakers 
  infected by HIV or having AIDS disease); and (3) <i>affected orphans</i> (those 
  who lost a parent affected by AIDS), infected or not.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UNGASS Declaration 
  defines several building blocks of a supportive environment for children and 
  adolescents (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29425t1.gif">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  had the purpose of describing the magnitude and status, as expressed in the 
  UNGASS Declaration, of several human rights of children and adolescents living 
  with HIV/AIDS, affected non-orphans and AIDS orphans in Brazil based on local 
  and international literature review.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODOLOGICAL 
  PROCEEDINGS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data was obtained from MEDLINE and Scholar Google
databases<i>.</i> Although searches were not conducted for
specific time periods, publications starting from 1980, in any
language, were included in the study. Other texts, abstracts and
articles from sources other than these databases were included
based on the authors' expertise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From studies estimating 
  the size of these populations, it was sought to concisely reconstruct their 
  methods and results to assess their feasibility and limitations. In regard to 
  rights, studies identifying human rights established in the 1988 Brazilian Constitution 
  and the Child and Adolescent Bill of Rights (ECA),<sup>3</sup> related to paragraphs 
  65 and 66 of UNGASS Declaration (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29425t2.gif">Table 2</a>), 
  were examined.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RIGHTS OF CHILDREN 
  AND ADOLESCENTS LIVING WITH HIV</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How many are there in Brazil living with HIV, affected
non-orphans, and orphans by AIDS? And what is their human rights
status?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are the questions still need to be answered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For those living with HIV/AIDS, data is available on AIDS
cases but not on HIV-infected individuals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest issue of the National Program for STD/AIDS Bulletin
reported that, in the period 1980&#150;2005, 10,404 AIDS cases were
notified in children under five, 3,905 cases in those aged five
to 12 years, and 8,075 in those aged 13 to 19 years.<sup>4</sup>
Since the disease peaked in 1997 (926 cases) and 1998 (943
cases), there has been fewer case reports of children under five.
However, a growing number of cases of children (5-12 years) and
adolescents (13-19 years) have been reported since 2002.
Incidence rates show similar trends to those of absolute cases.
The reduction of cases in children under five is mostly due to
advances in prevention of mother-to-child HIV
transmission<sup>12</sup> while declining absolute cases can be
explained by more children and adolescents surviving HIV/AIDS as
a result of universal free access to antiretroviral
therapy.<sup>12</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Qualitative studies have brought to light accounts of
adolescents living with AIDS and caretakers on their troublesome
condition regarding their rights to health, education, and
physical and mental integrity, all included in the UNGASS
Declaration and documented by Ayres et al<sup>1</sup> (2006). The
right to nutrition has been denied to some orphans infected and
affected by AIDS. Their realities are pervaded by stigma and
discrimination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for those affected non-orphans, there is a single study
conducted by the Global Orphan Project/Instituto Promundo,
supported by the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF).<sup>5</sup> A mathematical model was applied at three
different stages of risk (children living with AIDS mothers,
children living with HIV mothers and AIDS orphans). The following
variables were used for AIDS mothers: number of women living with
AIDS, number of children of mothers living with AIDS and adjusted
to AIDS infant and child mortality. As of August 1997, there were
57,600 children of mothers living with AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the second stage of the model, the following variables were
used for women living with HIV: number of women living with HIV,
estimated number of asymptomatic women living with HIV, number of
children of asymptomatic mothers living with HIV and adjusted to
overall infant and child AIDS mortality. A total of 136,650
children of HIV-infected mothers<sup>5</sup> were estimated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although this model included several correction factors, such
as delays in case reporting and underreporting, there are
limitations in the study. The potential biases are attributable
to the fact that this study was carried out before antiretroviral
therapy was available when little was known on the reproductive
life of those women infected. The two major limitations were that
those women deceased were not subtracted from the study
population and the use of fecundity rates similar to the general
female population. Both biases would imply in overestimation of
the number of children affected by their mothers' HIV status and
clinical condition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were not found studies considering the rights of
affected non-orphans.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RIGHTS OF CHILDREN 
  AND ADOLESCENTS ORPHANED BY AIDS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In regard to <i>AIDS orphans</i> in Brazil, there are
available three estimates based on mathematical models and a
household survey carried out in a state capital.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To evaluate the impacts of orphanhood, a first study was
developed by Global Orphan Project/<i>Instituto
Promundo</i>.<sup>5</sup> The variables used to estimate the
number of orphans were number of women who died from AIDS and
number of children born to mothers who died from AIDS adjusted to
infant and child AIDS mortality. It was estimated 15,900 children
under 15 of mothers who died from AIDS as of August 1997. It was
also predicted there would be 27,000 orphans by the year
2002<sup>4</sup>. While Fontes et al<sup>5</sup> (1998) corrected
death underreporting in their study modeling, potential
overestimation occurred because fecundity rates were assumed to
be similar to the general female population.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two years later, Szwarcwald et al<sup>16</sup> (2000), also
using a mathematical model, estimated that 30,000 Brazilian
children under 15 would have been orphaned by their mothers dying
from AIDS in the period 1987 to 1999. Their model was based on
multiplying the accumulated fecundity rate for the study period
by the number of deaths from AIDS among women aged 15 to 49
years, corrected by the likelihood of child survival between five
and nine years of age. This study estimated that, in 1999, 5,500
children would have been orphaned by their mothers dying from
AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are two potential biases in this model: use of
uncorrected fecundity rates of general female population and use
of expected perinatal mortality of 90% of HIV-infected children.
This expected mortality was already declining as a result of
universal access to antiretrovirals since 1996. It should be
noted that these factors take effect in opposite directions but
key factors for estimating the number of orphans are the number
of women who died and their fecundity rates.<sup>8</sup> Thus
potential overestimation was likely in this model.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third model 
  studied was developed by the Jointed United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), 
  UNICEF and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).<a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
  On the first edition of Children on the Brink (2002), 127,000 AIDS orphans were 
  estimated in Brazil in 2001, where 34,000 would be maternal and 100,000 paternal 
  orphans. This estimate is slightly higher than those previously projected. A 
  more complex model was used including the following variables: estimated AIDS 
  mortality based on the North Princeton mortality charts, fecundity rates adjusted 
  to less than 20% of the original rates for female population and the likelihood 
  of those HIV-infected children surviving up to 15 years of age.<sup>8</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This model has also potential biases. The number of deaths was
obtained from an estimate assuming a median survival time of nine
years (8.6 years for men and 9.4 for women) after clinically
diagnosing AIDS. In Brazil, the estimate of 9-year survival seems
to be very short. It is well documented the dissociation between
AIDS prevalence and mortality rates attributed to a government
program of universal free access to medical care.<sup>10</sup>
The number of orphans declines as women survival increases so
their children are able to live beyond 15 years of age.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another potential bias is the estimate of fecundity rates
lower than 20% in local epidemics. Actual fecundity rates of
Brazilian women living with HIV/AIDS are unknown. Grassly et
al<sup>8</sup> (2004) state that 50% decrease in fecundity rates
would dramatically reduce the estimated number of orphans. These
factors suggest an overestimated number of orphans. At last,
adjusting child mortality in a scenario of free access to AIDS
therapy should be reviewed because it points out to the opposite
direction showing an increased number of orphans living with
AIDS.<sup>13</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, on the 
  second edition of Children on the Brink (2004), UNAIDS, UNICEF and USAID stated 
  there would be no estimates of AIDS orphans in Brazil, among others.<a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
  They first alleged that these would be low prevalence epidemics and a significant 
  number of cases would come from groups such as intravenous drug users and men 
  having sex with men with unknown fecundity rates, resulting in a low accuracy 
  model.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While these estimates 
  have been obtained using different methodology at different time periods, they 
  seem to be consistent ranging from 30,000 (1999),<sup>16</sup> 34,000 (2001)<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
  to 27,000 (2002)<sup>5</sup> maternal orphans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All indications 
  are that to know the number of orphans in Brazil hereafter estimates should 
  be based on more updated and refined mathematical models including data on adult 
  and child mortality and fecundity rates or actual population counts through 
  surveys. Surveys are explicitly recommended in the UNGASS report on indicators.<a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Doring et al<sup>2</sup> (2005) conducted the first
population-based survey on AIDS orphanhood in the city of Porto
Alegre, Southern Brazil, and were able to locate the address of
80% of all deceased (n=1,616) between 1998 and 2001. Of 1,294
people found, 43.4% (n=562) were survived by 1,131 children under
15 years. For every group of 10 deceased found in the study there
were about 8.8 orphans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Population-based surveys in Brazil based on mortality data
have major limitations: differential underreporting of AIDS
deaths; great geographical mobility, especially of poor families
affected by AIDS deaths; and difficulty in localizing children
sheltered in institutions or living on the streets.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By extrapolating Doring et al<sup>2</sup> (2005) findings,
42,876 deaths reported in Brazil between 1998 and 2001 would have
resulted in 37,474 children orphaned by AIDS, about 50% (18,846)
of them maternal orphans. This extrapolation should be carefully
considered since different Brazilian regions have distinctive
demographic characteristics and HIV/AIDS epidemic profile.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to human rights, Doring et al<sup>2</sup> (2005)
have interestingly found relatively low institutionalization rate
of orphans (5%) (in opposition to the rights to shelter and
family life) in Porto Alegre. But the associated factors
identified (HIV-infected 4.6 x; maternal loss 5.9 x; or both 3.7
x; child born to a non-white mother 4 x) show persisting stigma
and discrimination associated to HIV status, gender, and
race.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marques et al<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a> 
  (2004) evaluated income transfer programs and general aid to those living with 
  HIV/AIDS and their orphans in three Brazilian municipalities. They identified 
  isolated initiatives for improving life conditions of those at risk or vulnerable, 
  especially those below the line of poverty, that could be extended to those 
  living with HIV/AIDS. But they would need to be adjusted to this population 
  and they lie far from reaching all those affected. Income can be either a facilitating 
  or hindering factor of access to rights such as education, shelter, and nutrition.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As mentioned before, studies in the literature on children and
adolescents infected and affected by HIV/AIDS disease or death
are still scarce and studies on human rights are even rarer.
Global consensus as expressed in the UNGASS allow investigators
to focus their research in collaboration with local and
international scientific communities and consistent with
potential public programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is thus a need to develop initiatives that will help to
build up in the coming years a monitoring system of children and
adolescents infected and affected by HIV/AIDS epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hence it would be valuable <i>to adjust</i> and/or
<i>create</i> information systems to provide data on those
infected and affected (orphaned or not) by the epidemic and their
social condition. Information confidentiality should be further
reassured since AIDS deaths are a sensitive issue and could give
rise to violations of rights such as privacy and dignity among
others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With respect to <i>adjusting</i>, epidemiological reporting
forms and death certificates, which are filled out in health
services, could be redesigned to include other information fields
such as number, age, and degree of kinship of children and
adolescents related to the index-case (who is either infected,
diseased or died). This will require convincing health
information system managers on the usefulness of monitoring those
affected (orphaned or not) by the epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the National 
  Program for STD/AIDS, orphanhood-related concerns could be included in standard 
  studies on draftees and sexual behavior.<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a> 
  Ethical concerns should be reinforced in these initiatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, it could be suggested to the Brazilian Institute
of Statistics and Geography (IBGE) the inclusion of specific
information fields to identify deaths occurring at home (name,
date of birth, date and cause of death) and any related children
and adolescents (number, age, and degree of kinship with the
deceased, covering the previous 12 months). IBGE census,
population counts and surveys, such as the National Household
Sample Survey (PNAD), can all be potential sources of information
on orphanhood magnitude and profile. This will definitely require
even more exhaustive discussions and technical definitions.
Another proposal is to draw on school census but being careful
for not exposing school children and adolescents orphaned by AIDS
to further stigma and discrimination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for <i>creating</i> 
  new sources of information, the Ministry of Health, via National Program for 
  STD/AIDS, could reasonably implement a compulsory reporting system of HIV infection, 
  which can provide data to assess the magnitude of HIV infection among children 
  and adolescents. This new system could also provide information on any children 
  and adolescents related to HIV-infected adults (number, age, and degree of kinship 
  with those living with HIV). This has been considered a controversial proposal 
  in collective health. The United States has adopted a confidential name-based 
  HIV infection reporting system since 1994, and valuable lessons can be learned 
  from the American experience.<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Civil registries, where death certificates are registered, are
another potential source of information on orphanhood since
surviving children are inventoried for testamentary purposes.
Regretfully this information has not been much used as these
registries are hardly accessible in Brazil due to scattered
notary offices controlled by judiciary authorities. These
obstacles can be overcome unless other social actors, such as
judges, notaries, among others, would be involved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Creating new or 
  adjusting existing information sources could offer data on the magnitude of 
  children and adolescents affected, directly or indirectly, by HIV/AIDS infection, 
  disease or death in Brazil. However, there is a need of further information 
  to evaluate whether specific targets, as listed in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29425t2.gif">Table 
  2</a>, are being achieved or not. For that, periodical population-based surveys 
  to thoroughly measure life conditions and human rights status of those infected 
  and affected would be paramount. These initiatives could develop by the Brazilian 
  Ministry of Health in collaboration with research support agencies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With respect to 
  the paucity of data on human rights of those children orphaned or affected by 
  HIV, the Brazilian government recognizes the limited outreach of public policies 
  on this matter. The answer given by the Brazilian government in a 2002 report 
  in reply to the UNGASS proposed question, "Are there any programs or strategies 
  targeting the additional needs of those orphaned and other vulnerable children?" 
  corroborates this finding: "Support homes for those children affected by HIV/AIDS; 
  availability of milk formula to those children exposed to mother-to-child HIV 
  transmission; intervention programs targeting children living on the streets 
  and imprisoned adolescents"<i>.<a name="top10"></a></i><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, despite its limitations, the present study
indicates the need for creating mechanisms for more properly
assessing the magnitude of children orphaned or affected by
HIV/AIDS epidemic and relevant conditions for their adequate
care. On the other hand, it should be noted an existing concern
for promoting, protecting, and respecting human rights although
actions taken to control the impact of the epidemic on children
and adolescents are to date limited.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agenda on human 
  rights proposed by UNGASS for creating a supportive environment is extensive 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29425t2.gif">Table 2</a>). Overall, the literature review 
  made possible to document the existing wide gap. The required programs and strategies 
  to actually exercise the concerned rights and monitor their status have not 
  been implemented yet. There is still more to know and much to do in Brazil.</font></p>
