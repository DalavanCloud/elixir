<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To verify the prevalence of self-reported voice alteration among educators in 
  cr&egrave;ches, and associated factors.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> This was a cross-sectional observational study carried out in 
  2000, in eight cr&egrave;ches in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo at which actions 
  within the Cr&egrave;che Program were being developed. This program formed part 
  of the health promotion activities of a speech therapy investigation laboratory. 
  The data collection was done by means of a questionnaire that was filled out 
  by 93 educators, with questions on sociodemographic characteristics, aspects 
  of the organization and physical environment of the work, habitual voice utilization, 
  history of illnesses, lifestyle and perceptions regarding voice alterations. 
  Assessment of hearing perception was done on the participants' voices. The statistical 
  analysis utilized proportions, central trend measurements, Chi-square test with 
  Yates correction and multiple logistic regression analysis.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Eighty percent of the educators reported that they had voice 
  alterations, although only 26% had sought treatment. A large proportion (39%) 
  reported that they had had their problem for four years or more, that it was 
  intermittent (82%) and that they had it to a slight or moderate degree (74%). 
  They believed that the main cause of voice alteration was their use of their 
  voices (82%), and their principal symptom was hoarseness (54%). Self-reported 
  voice alteration was statistically associated with presence of voice alteration 
  observed during assessment and with having had some guidance on voice usage.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Adequate perception among educators regarding their voice 
  problems could become an important tool for future work among this population 
  with a view to diminishing the high prevalence of voice alteration encountered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies have identified greater presence of dysphonia among
teachers than among other professionals. This has also been
observed in studies on professional categories attended at voice
rehabilitation services.<sup>10,12</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the United States, teachers present a mean of twice the
number of negative vocal symptoms and physical discomfort as
presented by professionals with less demand on their
voices.<sup>10</sup> In Brazil, teachers who took part in a large
study in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo reported a mean of two
negative vocal symptoms.<sup>4</sup> There is no consensus in the
literature regarding the majority of factors associated with the
presence of voice alterations.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many teachers take sick leave because of voice problems and
tend not to seek treatment that might directly resolve the
problem. When teachers present voice alterations, this may
compromise teaching-learning relationships, since comprehension
of the message may be made difficult.<sup>1</sup> Voice problems
add to other problems that teachers experience, thereby
increasing their difficulties in managing their work, health and
lives. Environmental factors and factors relating to organizing
the workplace have been little studied in relation to teachers'
voices.<sup>14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important that these professionals should be capable of
identifying the presence of alterations in their voices. Through
this, the chance that they would seek specific treatment would be
increased and the development of inadequate adjustments when
speaking despite such alterations (a very common situation) would
be impeded. The negative adjustments include speaking very loudly
and forcefully in noisy environments, using an upper respiratory
voice pattern or an inadequate resonance focus, among others.
These may lead to overload in the vocal system, thus facilitating
the appearance of voice alterations. Early diagnosis would lead
to lower impact from the voice alterations over the medium to
long term, and would reduce the length of treatment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National and international studied carried out to investigate
the prevalence of self-reported voice alteration have found
between 20% and 75% among elementary school, high school and
university-level teachers.<sup>4,7,10-12</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Educators of children who attended cr&egrave;ches perform
teaching activities, but there are no Brazilian studies on voice
alterations among this group. Therefore, the objective of the
present work was to investigate the prevalence of voice
alterations among cr&egrave;che educators and their relationship
with self-reported voice alterations.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A cross-sectional observational study was carried out in 2000
in eight cr&egrave;ches in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, in which
actions within the Cr&egrave;che Program were being developed.
This Program forms part of a speech therapy investigation
laboratory for health promotion. Since 1985, this Program has
been directing its actions towards work with educators, children
and families in the fields of language, hearing, oral
myofunctional system, speech, fluency and voice. Among the eight
cr&egrave;ches participating in this study, one was administrated
and supervised by the municipal authority of S&atilde;o Paulo
(PMSP), four were run under arrangement with PMSP and three were
supervised by the social assistance coordination office of the
Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo (Coseas/USP). The age range of
the children attended in these cr&egrave;ches was from zero to
six years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the 108 educators at these eight cr&egrave;ches were
invited to participate in the research. Fourteen were unable to
take up the invitation because of lack of available time outside
of working hours. Among the 94 (87%) who were able to
participate, it was decided to exclude one subject, because this
was the only man in the group. Thus, 93 educators (all women)
took part in the study, corresponding to 86.1% of the total
initial population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The educators received 
  explanations about the research and guidance regarding filling out a questionnaire. 
  This instrument was devised using questions relating to sociodemographic characteristics, 
  aspects of the work and the organization of the work, voice use pattern, history 
  of diseases, lifestyle and perception regarding voice alterations. Its objective 
  was to assist in studies involving teachers' voices,<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  and a validation process for it is underway.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The questionnaire was returned three days later, and the
educators underwent individual voice assessment at this
time.<sup>3</sup> This assessment was conducted in the
cr&egrave;che itself, in a room that was away from the main
activities and therefore more quiet. It was performed by a single
speech therapist with experience in the field of voice, who is an
author of this paper (MS). Among the various voice parameters
evaluated, voice quality was selected as best representing the
combination of voice characteristics. Through this, the
educators' voices were classified as adequate or altered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dependent variable was the presence of voice alteration
and the independent variables were the characteristics evaluated
in the questionnaire. The Chi-square test with Yates correction
was used for investigating associations. Multiple logistic
regression analysis was performed using the variables that
presented statistical significance in the association test. Odds
ratios (OR) were used as the measurement for estimated risk and
the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to investigate the fit of the
multiple logistic regression model. For all the analyses, the
significance level utilized was 5%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This research was granted approval by the Research Ethics
Committee of the Faculdade de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica of
Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo, and all participants signed a
statement of free and informed consent.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The educators' ages ranged from 19 to 56 years, with a mean of
31 years. Their mean length of time in the profession was 6.5
years, and 37% had worked in this profession for nine years or
more. They had a high level of education: 49.4% of the educators
had completed high school and 36.6% had completed
university-level education. The majority of them (97.8%) only
worked in one cr&egrave;che. Around 44% said they made frequent
use of their voices in other activities outside of their work,
and the main ones among these were in taking care of children
(20.4%) and singing in church (17.2%).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voice alterations were self-reported by 74 educators (79.6%),
and 36 of them (48.7%) considered that this alteration was
present at the time of the study. Nineteen of the educators
(25.7%) had sought treatment, while 20.5% used medications and
only 9.5% had sought speech therapy care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For these professionals, the main causes of voice alteration
(more than one cause could be mentioned) were: use of the voice
(82.4%), speaking in noisy environments (37.8%) and/or stress
(33.8%). Causes related to history of diseases (allergy,
infections of the upper airways and colds) appeared less
frequently.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of the educators believed that their voice problems were
intermittent (82.4%). The problems had been present for more than
six months (93.2%), and the most frequently reported duration of
alteration was four years or more (39.2%). Many of the educators
(74.3%) believed that their voice alterations were of slight or
moderate degree. Better voice in the morning was cited by 32
educators (43.2%), worse voice in the morning by 30 (40.5%),
voice unchanged over the course of the day by 10 (13.5%) and
voice varying over the course of the day by two (2.8%).
Twenty-two educators (29.7%) had been absent from work because of
voice alteration, and the length of this absence ranged from a
few hours to five days.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main negative vocal symptoms cited were: hoarseness
(54.1%), tiredness of the voice (51.4%), pitch variation (25.7%)
and/or loss of the voice (18.9%). The main negative sensory
symptoms were: dryness in the throat (58.1%), throat clearing
(48.6%), pain when speaking (29.7%) and/or burning sensation
(25.7%). The auditory-perceptive evaluation of the voice
identified 79.6% of the 93 professionals with alterations in the
quality of their voices. It needs to be clarified that this
percentage does not correspond exactly to the educators who
reported voice alterations, even though the percentages found
were the same.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the prevalence of voice alterations, the relationship
between the educators' self-reported voice alterations and the
presence of voice alterations detected by the speech therapy
evaluation could be studied. A statistically significant
association was found (p=0.0032) and it was seen that, among the
educators who reported such alterations, 86.5% really presented
them (positive predictive valor), and among those who said they
did not have such alterations, 47.4% did not present them in the
speech therapy evaluation (negative predictive value). The
sensitivity of the instrument utilized was 87% and the
specificity was 47%. There was also a statistically significant
association between self-reported voice alteration and having
received guidance regarding appropriate use of the voice
(p=0.0340).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the multiple 
  logistic regression analysis (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e08t1.gif">Table</a>), self-reported 
  voice alteration was shown to be an independent factor associated with the presence 
  of voice alteration (OR=4.5). The other characteristic selected for the model 
  was the presence of dust, because this also presented an association with voice 
  alteration.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study was the first in Brazil to analyze the
presence of self-reported voice alteration among educators in
cr&egrave;ches. Similar studies among teachers working at other
teaching levels are more common.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A high prevalence of voice alterations was observed among the
participating educators, and this result is similar to what was
found in two literature reviews in voice alterations among
teachers working at different teaching levels.<sup>5,9</sup> This
indicates the need for actions among this population with a view
to preparing educators for professional use of their voices, in
seeking to diminish the occurrence of problems of this nature
among these professionals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An association was verified between self-reported voice
alteration and voice alterations observed in the speech therapy
evaluation, thus indicating that the educators in this study were
aware of their voice problems. These data were not registered in
other studies.<sup>2,6,9</sup> The present results indicate the
possibility of other approaches towards this population, in which
for example an initial screening could be done by the educators
themselves. In the light of the sensitivity of 87% and
specificity of 47% that were seen, this approach becomes valid,
as was seen in an Australian study.<sup>8</sup> In the present
study, it was not possible to study the relationship between
voice symptoms and voice alterations, since the symptoms were
only reported by the educators who self-reported voice
alterations on the questionnaire.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The educators studied had frequent opportunities to talk to
speech therapists about their doubts relating to voice use. This
probably kept them a little more alert to this problem, although
it was noticed that the educators sought out the speech
therapists to clarify more doubts relating to their work with the
children than in relation to concerns for their own health. In
other studies, no significant association was found between
self-reported voice alterations and the presence of voice
alterations detected by speech therapists, but it was observed
that many teachers perceived their alterations.<sup>2,6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the high percentage of educators who reported the
presence of voice alterations, it was seen in the present study
that few sought treatment, and this finding is similar to what
was seen in other studies.<sup>9,12,13</sup> It is believed that
this resulted from chronically living with the problem, which led
the educators to adapt to the situation by means of negative
voice adjustments while using their voices professionally, such
as speaking loudly and forcefully. This has also been observed in
other studies.<sup>9,12</sup> Moreover, it was observed that most
of the educators reported intermittent voice alterations, as was
also seen in an American study.<sup>12</sup> This may have made
them believe that their voices would always get better naturally,
thereby dispensing with any specific assistance. They may not
have perceived whether their voices came back worse after each
episode, considering that the fundamental factor seemed to be "to
have a voice" and not necessarily "to have a good voice". This
hypothesis can be reinforced by the observation that most of the
participant classified their voice alterations as slight or
moderate, i.e. despite the voice alteration, they continued to
use their voices in their work, even if the quality of their
voices was worse. The altered voice may become the teacher's
habitual voice, with the result that the teacher ceases to be
concerned about this. Furthermore, there seems to be a belief
among teachers that voice problems are inherent to their
profession, which may also devalue the possible signs and
symptoms.<sup>13</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact that the main way in which treatment was sought was
through the use of medications suggests a possible association
with self-medication and its risks, although the present study
did not investigate whether indications for these medications had
been given in previous medical consultations. If the practice of
self-medication were to be proven, it must be discouraged and
such individuals should be encouraged to seek out specialized
services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering that the mean length of time in the profession was
6.5 years and the length of time with voice alterations that was
most frequently self-reported was four years or more, it was seen
that voice alterations were starting relatively early among these
educators. This reinforces the idea that the risk factors have a
rapid negative impact on the voice when used without
preparation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data relating to the causes of the voice alterations cited
by the educators were similar to what was found in other studies,
considering that poor use of the voice is mentioned in the
literature as the principal factor responsible for dysphonia
among professional users of the voice.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Around half of the educators with self-reported voice
alterations said that their voices were better in the morning and
worsened over the course of the day, while the other half said
their voices were worse in the morning and improved during the
day. Another study<sup>13</sup> found similar data and it is
believed that this points towards two different groups with
regard to voice alterations: one with voice fatigue after
prolonged, excessive or inappropriate use, and the other with a
possible condition of hypofunctioning of the vocal folds or with
laryngeal alterations present that have the result that the
alteration in voice quality does not disappear, even after
resting the voice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The voice symptoms reported by the educators in this study
were similar to those found in other studies: dry throat,
hoarseness, tiredness of the voice, throat clearing and pain when
speaking.<sup>9,13</sup> These symptoms are directly related to
conditions of excessive or inappropriate use of the voice, and
also point out the presence of dust and/or noise in the
environment and little hydration during the professional use of
the voice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The absences from work caused by the presence of voice
alterations that were seen in the present study were similar to
those in other studies conducted outside of
Brazil.<sup>10,11,13</sup> This is a worrying situation, since
such absences were of the order of 30%. The mean number of days
off work or absent appears to be sufficient time for the voice to
return to the minimum condition for working, but probably without
full recovery, which may make it easier for new alterations to
emerge.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present study, an association was seen between the
presence of self-reported voice alterations and having received
guidance for appropriate use of the voice. The statistical
significance of this association reinforces the importance of
receiving guidance on the appropriate use of the voice. The data
suggest that such guidance improved the educators' perception of
their voice alterations, although not affecting the occurrence of
vocal alteration. It would be important to analyze the content
and form of such guidance, to make it effective in diminishing
the prevalence of voice alteration among these educators. This
guidance should encourage the seeking of treatment, thereby
avoiding the gradual onset of negative voice adjustments and
accommodation to such patterns among these professionals. It is
necessary to involve all the professionals in the institution,
and particularly those who are in positions of leadership, since
it is not just individual changes regarding voice use that are
needed. General modifications relating to all the unfavorable
characteristics are also indispensable, and these may include
from the routine of daily activities to the physical environment
of the cr&egrave;che itself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apart from the benefits educators get from detecting their own
voice alterations, such detection is important as a tool for
actions to be carried out among larger population groups. These
actions must be put into effect in the most rapid and least
costly manner for institutions and for the professionals who
require them and might benefit from intervention work. Early
detection of voice alteration may diminish the amount of time off
work, with or without a doctor's note, and the readaptation due
to this voice problem. Teachers without voice problems have more
choices of work, a factor that must be taken into consideration
nowadays. Absence of voice alterations among educators forms part
of the appropriate conditions for teaching
children.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through better perception of their voices, teachers may be
able to be more active in disseminating this knowledge among
other professionals with whom they have contact, which could
change the position that voice problems are inherent to
teaching.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present work, it was observed that the educators with
self-reported voice alterations have a 4.5 times greater chance
of really having voice alterations, and that this perception is
associated with having received previous guidance on voice use.
In this light, it is believed that it is of fundamental
importance to invest in programs that would ensure such
self-perception, thereby speeding up the development of actions
and obtaining positive results among this population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, the present study found a high prevalence of
self-reported voice alteration among educators in cr&egrave;ches,
and this was directly associated with the presence of voice
alterations detected by assessments. Having received guidance on
appropriate use of the voice was also shown to be associated with
the presence of self-reported voice alterations.</font></p>
