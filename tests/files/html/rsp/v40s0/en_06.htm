<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The focus of the 
  present study is the Brazilian response within science, technology and innovation 
  to the targets formulated in the UNGASS document. An analysis was made of items 
  70-73 of the UNGASS Draft Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (2001), which 
  defined science, technology and innovation targets relating to HIV/AIDS. The 
  main topics listed in these items were put into operation in the form of keywords, 
  in order to guide systematic searches within the standard biomedicine databases, 
  also including the subdivisions of the Web of Science relating to natural and 
  social sciences. The success of Brazilian research within the field of characterization 
  and isolation of HIV-1 is undeniable. Phase II/III vaccine studies have been 
  developed in Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and S&atilde;o Paulo. Empirical 
  studies on the monitoring of primary resistance have been developed in specific 
  populations, through the Brazilian HIV Resistance Monitoring Network. Within 
  the field of monitoring secondary resistance, initiatives such as the National 
  Genotyping Network have been highlighted. Two national systems &#150; the Mortality 
  Information System and the Notifiable Diseases Information System-AIDS&#150; 
  and some studies with wider coverage have given rise to work on trends within 
  the epidemic. The production of high-quality generic medications and their free 
  distribution to patients have been highlighted. Brazil has implemented a consistent 
  and diversified response within the field of HIV/AIDS, with studies relating 
  to the development of vaccines, new medications and monitoring of the epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The base document of the United Nations General Assembly
Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) defines targets for Science,
Technology and Innovation relating to HIV/AIDS in its items
70-73. The present text analyses some of the main items in this
section, giving emphasis to core questions in public health,
rather than to its interfaces with broader markers for action
within civil society, for formulation and implementation of
public policies and for industrial policy strategies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some matters that have not been dealt with cannot be retrieved
from the databases that guided the search for references. Such
information often cannot be retrieved through investigations of
any public database. This is because it comes from official
documents that are sometimes confidential in nature; sometimes
they are indeed industrial secrets (regarding the development of
new drugs). Therefore, the present review must not be seen as
exhaustive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This review included standard databases in biomedicine, as
well as their interfaces with the fields of Science, Technology
and Innovation ("STI"). However, since this is a pandemic taking
place in a world where several global STI networks are in
operation, the analysis of the Brazilian response within STI must
incorporate in its discussion the key texts that are produced
worldwide. Because of the extent of the present review, the
results are presented in the form of two papers, of which the
present article is the first part.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODOLOGICAL 
  PROCEDURES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main subjects 
  listed in items 70-73 of the UNGASS document were worked on as key words ("uniterms") 
  to guide systematic searches in the main databases within biomedicine, such 
  as MEDLINE and SciELO. <i>A priori</i>, no specific time period or geographical 
  delimitation was defined for the searches, despite the obvious emphasis on publications 
  that gave Brazilian responses, written by Brazilian and/or foreign authors who 
  are continuously active in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The topic of "STI in HIV/AIDS" goes beyond the field of
biomedicine and has interfaces with social life, as well as
scientific and technological policies, and it is related to
questions within the sociology of science (which were dealt with
circumstantially here). Thus, the searches in the bibliographic
databases also included the Institute for Scientific Information
(ISI), through its Web of Science, in its subdivisions relating
to Natural Sciences (SCI-Expanded) and Social Sciences
(SSCI).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was no historical aim, such as retrieval of the
recollections of social movements or critical analysis of the
interface between activism, public policies and decision-making,
in relation to essential questions like access to antiretroviral
drugs. Within this, a mixture of initiatives from civil society
and judicial decisions exist, which go beyond the field of STI
but may have a central role regarding scientific and
technological developments that were translated into practical
measures.<sup>35</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Items 70-73 of the document contain a broad and heterogeneous
HIV/AIDS research agenda. For this reason, we chose to emphasize
certain items, in particular the fields in which the Brazilian
and international indexed literature are shown to be more
consistent. Some topics such as international cooperation in STI
cannot be retrieved from indexed scientific papers, and these are
carried in government and agency reports, in the so-called "gray
literature". Such articles are of vital importance for the
formulation of policies, but access to them is restricted to
policy formulators and their closest interlocutors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise, it was not possible to review the whole collection
of Brazilian research accumulated over more than two decades of
conferences on HIV/AIDS. In particular, the large international
conferences that initially took place annually and are now
biannual can be mentioned. Submissions of papers by Brazilian
authors form the second or third largest body of work in the
world, after the United States, the world leader in research. The
collection of Brazilian abstracts presented at the largest
international congresses in the field is of the order of
thousands of studies (International AIDS Conference, Retrovirus
and Opportunistic Infections Conference, and the International
AIDS Society Conference on Pathogenesis and Treatment). They
include papers ranging from basic science to the evaluation of
actions by local services and by non-governmental
organizations.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ANTI-HIV/AIDS 
  VACCINES AND MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At present, the development of vaccines for HIV/AIDS is going
through a crisis. Despite the progress in the fields of molecular
biology, virology and immunology, as yet there are no consensual
definitions for optimal combinations of specific immune responses
that would indeed be protective against HIV.<sup>44</sup>
Likewise, although the worldwide efforts within the field of
HIV-1 molecular epidemiology are praiseworthy, there are no clear
parameters that allow for correlation between the viral diversity
and specific patterns of transmissibility,<sup>64</sup> immune
response<sup>28</sup> and "natural" history of the
infection.<sup>25</sup> "Natural" is here in quotation marks
because in Brazil there are no "natural histories" of infection
by HIV, since there is widespread availability of antiretroviral
medications that totally alter the natural course of the
infection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paradigm of sterile immunity seems to have been
definitively supplanted. In its place, some other alternatives
have emerged: these include vaccines that would allow partial
protection and/or slower evolution of the HIV infection towards
the clinical syndrome (AIDS), and would stop its progression, if
possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The complex interrelations 
  between the action of vaccines that induce partial protection (so called "imperfect" 
  vaccines) and initiatives within the field of prevention have been investigated 
  by British<sup>2</sup> and American<sup>8</sup> research teams at broad population 
  level. Although in the form of isolated initiatives, such questions are not 
  strange to Brazilian science.<sup>54</sup> There is, however, no single line 
  of research in Brazil that considers not only the mathematical modeling, but 
  also the collection of empirical data and parameter determinations from these 
  data, in the form of models bearing specific Brazilian characteristics. Efforts 
  along the lines of modeling the impact of imperfect vaccines should be encouraged 
  within the context of the co-circulation of different viral strains. As examples, 
  the paper from Blower et al<sup>9</sup> (2005) in South Africa and the recently 
  developed theoretical perspective developed by Massad et al<sup>55</sup> (2006) 
  can be cited.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The success of Brazilian research in the field of
characterizing and isolating HIV-1 is undeniable. Brazil has set
up a wide network of laboratories and stimulated academic
cooperation, with notable results from mapping the molecular
epidemiology of HIV, despite the size and regional diversity of
the country. With the exception of Salvador, Bahia, which has a
national reference laboratory and has produced some papers, the
research groups have undeniably been concentrated in the
Southeast region.<sup>26,32</sup> These groups have shown an
ability to establish partnerships with research teams in the
Northeast<sup>36</sup> and in other Latin American
countries.<sup>23,90</sup> Furthermore, teams with independent
production relating to coinfection between HIV and human
T-lymphotropic virus (HIV/HTLV) have emerged outside of the
science and technology axis in the Southeast, like in
Par&aacute;.<sup>45</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The monitoring on the progressive dissemination of HIV-1
subtype C in the Southern region of the country is impressive and
comparable with the most refined molecular epidemiological
studies worldwide.<sup>65,71,73</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the national effort to acquire skills for developing
phase II/III vaccine studies, important findings have been
obtained from studies conducted in Rio de Janeiro, RJ, and Belo
Horizonte, MG, and from preliminary studies in S&atilde;o
Paulo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a general manner, these Brazilian studies can be divided
into two categories. Firstly, there are studies developed from
primarily national initiatives with support from WHO and, more
recently, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), for example, recruiting men who have sex with men (MSM)
in Rio de Janeiro<sup>74-76,79</sup> and Belo
Horizonte.<sup>21,47</sup> Secondly, there are studies that form
part of an international network, initially in Rio de Janeiro,
and more recently in S&atilde;o Paulo, sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) of the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The projects sponsored by NIH basically consist of the
Pra&ccedil;a XI Project, which recruited MSM,<sup>41,60</sup> and
more recent projects that have been recruiting heterosexual men
and women who are at particular risk of HIV infection and other
sexually transmitted infections,<sup>6</sup> with some degree of
overlap between them.<sup>68</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the analysis of the Brazilian findings, there would not
be any way, at present, to test the vaccines of partial efficacy
in the field because, hypothetically, there would be little
difference in the rates of AIDS incidence and progression to AIDS
between those who were vaccinated and those who were not. This is
because, invariably, the populations recruited have low rates of
seroconversion to HIV (in addition to the generally slow
progression to the clinical syndrome).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the logistic problems have been overcome, with the
creation of an adequate clinical and laboratory infrastructure in
centers of excellence, and counting on patient retention rates
and availability of psychosocial support that do not differ from
international standards, there remains the challenge of
establishing and capacitating an expanded network of research
centers. This seems to be the only viable strategy within the
context of a stable epidemic (or even a declining one): to form a
"pool" of centers, recruiting volunteers in their thousands,
along the lines of recent initiatives in the United States that
have aimed to assess the role of HIV coreceptors in relation to
the acquisition and progression of HIV infection.<sup>56</sup>
Obviously, the immense size of such initiatives requires massive
investments and capacitation of significant numbers of
professionals, and also dialogue with civil society and
observance of standards of excellence regarding research
ethics.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>MONITORING VIRAL 
  RESISTANCE: PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RESISTANCE</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Brazil started to implement its policy of universal
access to antiretroviral drugs, there were many who predicted
that resistant strains would emerge in an "uncontrolled" manner,
using an erroneous metaphor that described developing countries
as "Petri dishes".<sup>63</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ten years have now passed since powerful antiretroviral
therapy (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy, HAART) was
introduced into Brazil. It must be emphasized that the country
has been capable of implementing the means for monitoring and
quality assessment, and it presents resistance rates that are
comparable to those observed in developed countries. On the other
hand, it is known that the emergence and possible transmission of
resistant strains is an undesirable but inevitable consequence of
large-scale introduction of antiretrovirals. It is, therefore, an
immense challenge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Viral resistance has two dimensions. From an individual focus,
its emergence is translated as therapeutic failure requiring
progressive substitution of the therapeutic methods in use at any
given time. Collectively, resistance means dealing with patients
presenting primoinfection with viruses that are resistant to
first-line medication,<sup>10</sup> and an ever-growing
proportion of newer, more complex and usually more expensive
medications that are protected by patent laws, participation in
the "portfolio" of therapeutic alternatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, due to the immediate challenges placed upon the
clinical management of people living with HIV/AIDS and undergoing
treatment, it is necessary to continuously monitor the emergence
of secondary resistance at its outset and, in parallel, to
implement systematic surveillance of primary resistance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the field of monitoring secondary resistance, the
initiatives of the National Genotyping Network (RENAGENO) and the
monitoring network for the emergence of secondary resistance in
patients presenting therapeutic failure can be highlighted. These
studies are nationwide<sup>84</sup> and regional,<sup>27</sup>
and also include studies on specific populations, such as
children living with HIV/AIDS who are using
HAART<sup>14,48,49</sup> and patients who are potential
transmitters of resistant viruses in the context of occupational
accidents.<sup>31</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the field of monitoring primary resistance, there are
prominent review papers<sup>72</sup> and empirical studies
developed among specific populations, such as the
soldiers,<sup>62</sup> blood donors<sup>30</sup> and a pool of
recently diagnosed patients in testing and counseling centers, by
the "Brazilian Network for Monitoring HIV Resistance"
(HIV-BResNet).<sup>15</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It has also been observed that there is a concentration of
publications in indexed journals from some research groups
located in centers of excellence in the Southeast region, albeit
in partnership with emerging groups in locations with less
infrastructure and experience (sometimes through networks with
national coverage). However, it must be mentioned that papers
published in indexed journals reflect more the scientific
"expertise" than the operational capacity of a given laboratory.
It is possible that there are laboratories with operational
capacity in terms of optimal interaction with the clinical
demands that are incapable of translating their findings into
scientific papers.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>NEW DRUGS AND 
  MEDICATIONS AND THEIR IMPACT ON PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question of the development of and access to new drugs and
medications for HIV/AIDS is central to controlling the epidemic.
Brazil has advanced considerably in the field of public policies
regarding treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS, having
implemented a pioneering program and wide-ranging access to
antiretroviral medications and monitoring. However, the presence
of adverse events from the different medications that make up the
therapeutic arsenal in use today and the emergence (and possible
transmission) of resistant strains are a continual challenge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil has advanced in four main ways: 1) operationally,
through the implementation of a network for acquisition, storage,
distribution and monitoring of antiretroviral drugs; 2) in
assessing the bioequivalence of generic drugs and producing them
domestically, even though <i>stricto sensu</i> scientific
publications in this field are still rare; 3) through introducing
Brazilian research centers into phase III/IV international
clinical trials; 4) through research on candidate products
(future drugs).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two weaknesses stand out. One of them, of a purely scientific
nature, is the almost complete lack of Brazilian studies on the
adverse events that are associated with antiretroviral drugs,
except for papers relating to secondary dyslipidemia through the
use of antiretroviral medications.<sup>50,66</sup> The second
weak point has its roots in the lack of capacity for transforming
innovations into finished industrial products, as has occurred in
the field of developing vaccines against different infectious
diseases and medications that are based on products coming from
Brazilian fauna and flora. In this latter case, the classic
example of Brazilian industry's inability to develop an
antihypertensive medication can be cited: the peptide isolated by
Brazilian researchers was subsequently patented by multinational
industrial companies. Isolated from jararaca snake venom, this
peptide is capable of inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I
into II, which is central to the dynamics of arterial
hypertension.<sup>78</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such questions relate to Brazilian technological capacity,
economic policy and, in particular, industrial policy, especially
in the fields of fine chemistry and drug development. Brazil has
not been able to fill the gap hiatus between innovation and
product development (except through joint ventures). In the field
of vaccine development (other than for HIV/AIDS), this challenge
has been met by technology transfers and cooperation agreements
between Brazilian institutions (such as the
Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Oswaldo Cruz and the Instituto Butantan),
and between these and international companies through
multilateral cooperation initiatives.<sup>17</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil has been using reverse engineering procedures with the
aim of understanding the processes involved in the synthesis of
essential drugs that are protected by patents. However, the
reverse engineering tool is only a short-term instrument for
obtaining reductions in the cost of acquiring medications,
insofar as it provides backing for the government's price
negotiations with the pharmaceutical industries and enables
national production of the drug in the event of patent loss.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the medium to long term, however, nothing replaces
national skills acquisition for developing all the phases in the
synthesis and production of new drugs that can subsequently be
transformed into commercial products. It is only in this way that
the country will cease to be led along by the multinational
companies, with its own logic for research and development and
its own strategies for putting products on the market and
establishing prices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil has been advancing in the search for original products
with antiretroviral activity, through a few research groups
working in this field. For example, products that act such that
they have the potential to inhibit the viral enzyme
protease,<sup>58</sup> or other phases of the viral replication
cycle, can be synthesized or extracted from compounds present in
algae<sup>4,59</sup> and in the African plant <i>Tabernanthe
iboga</i>.<sup>69</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Progress has also been seen in the development and application
of modern techniques for analyzing the bioequivalence of
antiretroviral drugs.<sup>43,46</sup> Likewise, studies on the
pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral medications under "real"
treatment conditions (i.e. beyond the usual evaluations under
"optimal" conditions) have considered the presence and effect of
intestinal parasitosis and malnutrition on the absorption of the
drugs.<sup>12</sup> Such studies are essential for the production
of high-quality generic drugs that are equivalent to the original
ones produced by the multinationals, and also for evaluating
generic and non-generic medications under "real" conditions of
use, as well as for their utilization under the controlled
conditions of phase III clinical trials.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently, Brazilian researchers have started studies in
the field of antiretroviral pharmacogenetics. Such studies are
essential over the long term, for defining medications and
therapeutic schemes that are appropriate for the genetic profile
of the Brazilian population.<sup>91</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the field of studies on new medications that are being
developed by the multinational pharmaceutical industry, Brazil
has actively participated in phase III multicenter protocols,
through some of its clinical research groups. Clinical
assessments of new medications and/or therapeutic schemes have
been performed on large groups of
patients.<sup>29,42,88,89,92</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a developing country with a program that makes
antiretroviral drugs available at zero cost to approximately
180,000 patients, it is essential to adequately implement the
different stages involved in the acquisition, storage,
prescription and distribution of these drugs. Furthermore, it is
also necessary to adequately monitor the different components of
the treatment, including compliance to therapeutic schemes,
management of complex cases<sup>51</sup> and evaluation of the
impact of the treatment on the survival and quality of life of
people living with HIV/AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies using different methodologies, assessing data that
sometimes relate to individual patients and at other times relate
to compiled databases, have demonstrated that HAART has had a
dramatic impact regarding increased survival of patients living
with HIV/AIDS.<sup>1,3,19, 40,53,67</sup> On the other hand,
there is still much to be done regarding systematic assessment of
the quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS who are
undergoing antiretroviral treatment. So far, there are only a few
multicenter trials, which are still at a preliminary stage
(validation of a standard tool) and are being developed by
specialists from the World Health Organization.<sup>94</sup>
There are also some studies on specific populations, such as
women living with HIV/AIDS who have relevant psychiatric
comorbidity.<sup>86</sup> This gap must be filled by Brazilian
research, coming from studies exclusively relating to survival
(which are undoubtedly essential) and going towards studies that
simultaneously incorporate the questions of the survival and
quality of life of patients living substantially longer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quality and broad coverage of Brazilian studies must also
be highlighted, in relation to compliance with antiretroviral
drugs, patients' characteristics,<sup>11,22,61</sup> health
professionals' characteristics,<sup>51</sup> and the context and
types of service within which the relationship between the health
professional and patient occurs,<sup>39</sup> and even with
regard to a set of factors relating to all these dimensions
analyzed together.<sup>57</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other papers have been exploring the relationship between high
levels of compliance with therapy (or, alternatively,
noncompliance) and the central clinical-laboratory parameters,
such as viral suppression or its diametric opposite, virological
failure.<sup>13,70,87</sup> Although much is being achieved in
Brazilian research, there is still much to be done in comparison
to the refinement that international research has reached in this
field. For example, there is room for careful monitoring of the
emergence of mutations and viral resistance caused by equally
subtle variations in the patterns of use of these medications.
Such variations in use may even lead to the creation of new
problems regarding the association between optimal compliance and
viral suppression, which are intuitively or empirically
verifiable under different circumstances.<sup>93</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though specific deficiencies in Brazilian scientific
production must be recognized, and despite the gaps in the fields
of fine chemistry or basic research for new drugs, there is no
doubt that Brazil has a leading role in the developing world, and
it has been acting as a vital partner in the South-South
cooperation networks relating to
HIV/AIDS.<sup>7,37,38,85</sup></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>MONITORING THE 
  EPIDEMIC (EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE AND MODELING)</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judicious implementation of public policies must take into
account the fact that the policies implemented represent an
investment of public money. Therefore, these policies must be
carefully assessed according to parameters that aim towards
equality and the maximization of results, with minimization of
non-justifiable spending. In order to achieve such an aim, it is
necessary to develop national monitoring systems to evaluate the
impact of effectively implemented measures and to correct the
courses of all the programs that are shown to have little or no
effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present segment leaves aside the ethical questions that
belong to each specific intervention. It documents the role of
analysis of the national database and specific surveillance and
monitoring studies in the formulation and monitoring of public
policies in the fields of prevention and treatment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A vast number of studies have been developed from the data in
the Notifiable Diseases Information System-AIDS (SINAN-AIDS) and
the Mortality Information System (SIM). Studies registered here
are solely those that, in effect, were population-based and had
national coverage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to the impact of antiretroviral therapy, the
pioneering study by Chequer et al<sup>24</sup> (1992) relating to
the pre-HAART period, and the studies by Marins et
al<sup>52,53</sup> (2003; 2005) relating to the period following
the introduction of HAART, deserve special attention. These
studies were developed from representative sample data from AIDS
cases registered in Brazil. There is also the study by Hacker et
al<sup>40</sup> (2004), which is of ecological nature. The recent
paper by Brito et al<sup>16</sup> (2005) explores the trends
within the epidemic in the post-HAART era, giving emphasis to
regional aspects. The question is also dealt with by Barbosa
&amp; Struchiner<sup>5</sup> (2003), by means of mathematical
modeling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil has studies that are representative of the population
and continuous in time, and this has made it possible to
establish trends within the epidemic, from analysis of serial
sectional study panels. The successive assessment rounds on data
from Brazilian army conscripts<sup>81,83</sup>, the sentinel
studies on pregnant women,<sup>77</sup> and also the use of the
latter for estimating the number of people infected with HIV in
this country can be highlighted.<sup>80</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the studies that are nationally representative, albeit
without periodicity (as yet), the recent papers by Szwarcwald et
al<sup>82</sup> (2005) and Calazans et al<sup>18</sup> (2005),
assessing sexual practices, risky behavior and protection for
young Brazilians, can be highlighted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of other information systems for evaluating public
policies has not been so successful, with few publications. This
indicates the deficient and even discrepant integration between
different systems. The work by Ferreira et al<sup>33,34</sup>
documents and evaluates the discrepancies between SINAN-AIDS and
the Hospital Information System.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of other information systems is still halting,
probably due to their incompleteness and/or inconsistency. This
is mentioned in the only paper on this subject that was found,
which indirectly used data relating to the dispensing of
antiretroviral drugs.<sup>20</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In summary, it can be seen that the two national systems (SIM
and SINAN-AIDS) and some studies of broader coverage have given
rise to papers published in indexed journals. The same needs to
be achieved by other studies with national coverage and databases
that present deficiencies that have made it difficult to analyze
their results. There is a need to improve, update and integrate
the databases that already exist, so that they can be fully
utilized for formulating, monitoring and assessing public
policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil has implemented a consistent and diversified response
within the field of HIV/AIDS, consisting of studies relating to
the development of anti-HIV/AIDS vaccines, including studies on
HIV molecular epidemiology, viral resistance monitoring, new
medications and epidemic monitoring.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the development of vaccines and their evaluation in
representative samples, Brazil today faces complex questions
relating to the dynamics of the epidemic itself (low prevalence
and incidence) and materials (infrastructure). On the other hand,
the country has been showing its competence in mapping out HIV
molecular epidemiology.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil is distinguished by high-quality domestic production of
generic drugs, even though the expansion of the offer of these
drugs at zero cost to patients is accompanied by significant
adverse effects, relating to different medications and
therapeutic schemes, and the emergence of resistant viral
strains, all of which are central questions for research on
HIV/AIDS today.</font></p>
