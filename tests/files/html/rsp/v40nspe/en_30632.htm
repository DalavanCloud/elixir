<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study analyzes factors and processes identified in the
literature that determine the patterns of production, use and
assessment of the health care technologies, which are part of the
"medicalization" of contemporary societies. We also evaluate the
scientific and technological public and health care policies
proposed during the 1990s in developed and developing countries
to enhance the impact of scientific and technological development
on population health. Problems facing these policies were
identified, as were the challenges to be overcome in the
twenty-first century.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The production, circulation and consumption of products and
services are essential to the sustainability of capitalist
societies, even when they occur under varying political and
social contexts. Products and services for health systems today
constitute an important economic activity at both the national
and international levels. Following the Second World War,
industrial development became increasingly dependent on
scientific and technological advances. This was particularly true
of sectors supplying the health systems: medicines, equipment and
various types of materials.<sup>46</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five factors are considered decisive elements in the expansion
of these production sectors in developed countries: 1) proposal
and implementation of scientific and technological policies by
the State, and the availability of public resources for
scientific research and technological development (the latter at
a smaller scale); 2) consolidation of health policies that
increased access to health care as part of the social and
political recognition of the right to health as an essential
right of the population; 3) strengthening the idea that medical
doctors possessed proper knowledge, competence and autonomy, and
the development of new types of services, health professions,
care models and diagnostic and therapeutical procedures; 4)
acceptance of health as having a social value and of its
"medicalization", that is, health problems are recognized as
medical problems to be addressed by the health services; 5)
changes in the demographic and epidemiological profiles of
populations (in the context of economic and social developments
that began in the 19<sup>th</sup> century) such as reduced
mortality by infectious diseases, increase and diversification of
chronic-degenerative diseases and increase in life expectancy,
which lead to new health requirements and demands on the health
services.<sup>11,23,36,51,55</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Identifying the "medicalization" of health, the expansion of
health systems, and the increasing demand on health services and
spending as important phenomena does not imply health care is a
more important determining factor for population health. The
literature produced on the relationships between health and
health care is large and multifaceted.<sup>17,26,41,58</sup> One
of these aspects is that, throughout time, all societies have
determined who should be responsible for the care of human,
physical, psychic and moral suffering. As in modern societies,
science came to assume qualities previously attributed to gods
and doctors became their priests; indeed "<i>sanare dolorem opus
divinum est</i>".<sup>42</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even in developed countries, studies on the determinant
factors of health/disease from a populational perspective clearly
show the continued and decisive importance of economical and
social living standards on health conditions. However, conceptual
and methodological difficulties arise when dealing with the
identification of causal factors and of the specific effects that
comprise the life of social groups with worse living conditions.
This, in light of the complex relationships between the
biological, psychological, cultural, social and economical
dimensions.<sup>1,12,28,34</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An additional difficulty in these analyses is defining the
components of health systems: i.e. all sectors and activities
with socially defined responsibilities relating to population
health (basic sanitary conditions; environmental, sanitary and
epidemiological vigilance; health education and professional
training; public safety; non-governmental organizations; and
others), or simply health services.<sup>16</sup> Life in a
society continually produces states of health/non-health in the
population. When individuals or the society consider the
"non-health" state as a disease and threat, health services have,
in contemporary societies, a central responsibility in
confronting this.<sup>39</sup> In all capitalist countries, the
complex historical economic and social processes led to the
"medicalization" of societies and to the development of systems
of health services with common characteristics. Recognizing this
fact does not preclude studies on specific circumstances and
contexts, in light of the various characteristics of health
services systems. Likewise, this recognition does not invalidate
the development of political and technical propositions with the
objective of making these systems contribute in the best way
possible to the well-being and health of the population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a global perspective, the 1990s were characterized by
recurring economic crises. Despite indisputable scientific and
technological advances, living conditions, for many, seemed worse
than in previous decades. It is inappropriate to discuss the
above statement here in the framework of economic and political
science. It suffices to note that in the field of health, the
global context was also characterized by persistent poverty and
an increase in social inequality and exclusion, unemployment and
the rise of the informal economy, population growth and aging,
extensive urbanization, economic and political instability,
weakening of the general governance of health systems, low
performance of the health systems, scientific and technological
development marked by the creation of new demands and costs, and
a complex profile of populational epidemiology with the
persistence of old problems and the emergence of new diseases.
During this time, it was believed that if health systems and
services underwent important transformations in their
characteristics and performance, they could contribute to the
reversal or decrease of these problems.<sup>4,32,33,54</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These changes could have been attained through general
political and economic actions and through the development of
specific sectorial policies able to integrate political and
economic objectives within processes of production,
incorporation, utilization and evaluation of technologies. Such
policies were proposed throughout the 1990s, most frequently by
the governments of developed countries; but also by those in
development, such as Brazil; and various Brazilian and
international organizations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article had as its objective the identification and
discussion of some of these proposals, their implementation and
the difficulties encountered since the beginning of the century.
A framework inspired by that proposed in the 1970s by the Office
of Technology Assessment (OTA) of the United Sates Congress for
the stages of development and dissemination of health care
technologies was adopted as the organizational strategy for this
discussion. Despite its dependence on a much criticized linear
model of scientific and technological development, this approach
was useful considering that its categories are still used in the
literature and in political proposals.<sup>6,43</sup> Two main
stages comprising the path for health care technologies from
knowledge to the socially incorporated technologies: the first
represent processes developed with successive intentions,
relatively integrated and outside the health services and
systems; the second the processes involving their evaluation and
utilization as technologies, of either product or process, in
health systems and services.</font></p>

  PRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Basic and applied research, development and innovation in
health</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The literature 
  on scientific and technology policy underscores the importance of the document 
  presented by Vanevar Bush to President Roosevelt following the Second World 
  War in 1945, in which he defended public investment in basic research (until 
  then primarily financed privately) and the creation of a national institute 
  responsible for it, leading to the creation of the National Science Foundation 
  (NSF) in 1950.<sup>24</sup> The document was based on central concepts that 
  were maintained as dogma during decades, and were present in the majority of 
  national scientific and technology policy proposals (including in Brazil): 1) 
  (true) science affirms itself through its own merits, and its primary motivation 
  should be the production of knowledge; 2) quality "pure" or basic research creates 
  conditions for the development of "applied" research and leads to technological 
  development and innovation, in a linear and sequential process; 3) only countries 
  possessing a strong foundation in research will be able to develop the technological 
  processes necessary for economic development.<sup>38</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30632t1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the official NSF report of 2000, there is an introductory
chapter called "Science and Technology in Times of Transition:
the 1940s and 1990s" that points to the similarities and
differences between these two periods. Notable as a
characteristic of the 1990s is the importance of public support
for policies that incorporate the need for the identification of
the complex relations (networks and interactions) between
research, technological development and innovation
(Nelson,<sup>37</sup> 2003). In addition to financial resources,
decisive and contemporary questions for the social impact of
research in the national and international perspective are:
information technologies, training for scientists, engineers, and
science instructors, partnerships between the public and private
sectors and social responsibility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the main issues hampering the increased impact of
research is the extreme concentration of human and financial
resources and scientific and technical competence within a very
small group of countries. For example, 85% of the most cited
articles between 1993 and 2001 were produced in only eight
countries, and 98% in 31 countries, including
Brazil.<sup>27</sup> Even if patterns could be identified that
differentiate performance for areas of knowledge and economic
indicators, and some mobility was seen as possible, it would be
necessary to change the general dynamic of global research and
development (R&amp;D) in order to make possible the contribution
of science and technology (S&amp;T) in decreasing
poverty.<sup>27</sup> Examples of the difficulties relating to
this are the constant conflicts between pharmaceutical
corporations, governments and international organizations
relating to research, development, patenting, production,
financing and distribution of medications.<sup>5,29</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the 
  Ministry of Science and Technology incorporated the questions about the impact 
  of S&amp;T in its policy proposals. Its "Livro Verde" <i>(</i>Green Book)<sup>35</sup> 
  (2001) emphasizes the expansion of research in Brazil throughout the 1990s, 
  mensurable by the number of graduated Ph.D.s, articles published in reviewed 
  journals and public resources allocated to research. On the other hand, recognition 
  was also given to the urgency needed in the development of mechanisms that increase 
  its potential for economic impact and contribution for the population's quality 
  of life.<sup>52</sup> A document drafted by the <i>Sociedade Brasileira para 
  o Progresso da Ci&ecirc;ncia</i> (SBPC - Brazilian Society for the Progress 
  of Science)<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> in 2005, affirms 
  as a priority the formulation of a State policy that creates norms, institutions 
  and structures that transcend the transitory nature of government administrations 
  and would be anchored in social and political consensus concerning the relevance 
  of S&amp;T for the country. In this document, topics emphasized included: the 
  importance of public universities, university-corporate relationships, interdisciplinary 
  dynamics, basic education and training of teachers, training in the engineering 
  sciences, financial and material resources, and policies and processes that 
  promote the impact of scientific and technological development in Brazilian 
  society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the annals of the 2<sup>nd</sup> National Conference on
Science, Technology and Innovation in Health in 2004,<sup>3</sup>
persistent problems were identified in the regional
decentralization and determination of human resources, in the
ability to manage innovation processes and in the dissemination
of scientific and technology information. In relation to the
productive health sector in Brazil, difficulties included
weakened production and increased importation during the 1990s.
As regards the promotion of research there were significant
increases in public investment, new financing protocols to
stimulate the transfer of technological knowledge and development
were created, an increase in the participation of state
(regional) funding agencies and a continuing difficulty in
estimating private investment. To address these problems and the
ethical commitment for improving, in a short, medium and long
term perspective, the health conditions of the Brazilian
population, it was decided that the National Policy for Science,
Technology and Innovation in Health should adopt as central
principles: extensivity; inclusiveness; selectivity;
complementarity; competitivity; scientific, technological and
ethical merit; social relevance; management responsibility; and
social control. For this, it will be necessary to increase and
diversify the sources of funding and implement new financing
mechanisms and definitions of priorities, in addition to those
traditionally used to support research.<sup>21</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the field of health, the demarcation between basic and
applied research, development and innovation of technologies in
health are particularly challenging. In technologies of
"traditional" products (equipment, medication, materials), it is
possible to identify intermediate steps, with processes and
actors relatively differentiated but, also, each time more
integrated. The common characteristic is the participation of an
entity outside of the health services, an industry, and the
non-participation, or at least reduced participation, of
"research subjects" in the development processes. For these
technologies, important questions for S&amp;T policy include: the
implementation of strategies to approach researchers and
corporations (such as technology "incubators"), the
identification of the impacts of more immediate financial
interests on the traditional processes of research (formulation
of scientific questions and methodologies and dissemination of
results),<sup>30</sup> and the differentiation between innovation
and technological improvements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, these product technologies only realize their
potential as diagnostic or therapeutic health care procedures
when they are part of process technologies that, in principle,
should also be based on scientific knowledge. However, in health
care, not all knowledge linked to an action is constructed by
means of processes recognized as "scientific research", which
does not diminish its value. The process technologies present in
health care have varied characteristics. They include everything
from procedures with more structured technical components, such
as those related to surgery, to programs of care, education and
management whose legitimacy is supported by other indicators.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally, surgical procedures are established by means of
production processes that are similar to product technologies,
having as a difference the fact that they are under the control
of medical doctors, and thus without the direct participation of
industry. Many of the process technologies presently incorporated
into health care have become the object of "research and
evaluation in health services and systems". Thus, through the
strengthening of the scientific basis for health care and for the
production of "evidence", an attempt is made to transform health
care. However, the challenge for this research is to overcome the
conceptual and methodological level and contribute to the
solution of problems, promoting quality of care and the
implementation of more effective health care policies and
producing positive impacts on care and population
health.<sup>7,13,41</sup> Without immediaterelations with health
services, the lines of research that propose to integrate
explicitly knowledge of various areas with the objective of
producing results useful for the resolution of health problems,
called "translational research" and "foresight policies", are
also part of this scenario of "research for action" (although
with a greatly different meaning from that of the
1970s).<sup>22,25</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, another important question is the growth of
bioethics as a social issue. This is particularly true of
clinical and research ethics with humans, given its impact on
research procedures. This theme is too large to be adequately
addressed here, particularly in the analysis of its impact on
services and health, and of the effective incorporation of ethics
as a transforming dimension for practices. However, it has
undoubtedly become part of the new policies and financing
procedures and in the approval of research projects, particularly
those involving risk to human research subjects, in the majority
of countries.<sup>10,15,50</sup></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>EVALUATION AND 
  UTILIZATION OF TECHNOLOGIES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Health policies or hurdles in a race to the market?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beginning in the 1970s in more advanced countries,
progressively more powerful public structures became responsible
for the initial analysis of medication, materials and equipment
that industries planned to introduce onto the market to be used
by the population and the health services as part of sanitary
vigilance. One of the emblematic institutions during this phase
is the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a pioneer in
the identification of the essential attributes of technologies
for the protection of population health (efficacy, security and
quality) and of the procedures used during trials as conditions
for commercialization.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the initial 
  phase, analyses and trials were both the responsibility of the FDA or third 
  parties recommended by it. With time, however, this framework became considered 
  excessively bureaucratic and time-consuming. In the 1990s, such evaluative studies 
  became the responsibility of corporations, with results analyzed, verified and 
  approved (or not) by the public authorities. This tendency is mirrored in the 
  sanitary vigilance of nearly all developed countries. In Brazil, the <i>Ag&ecirc;ncia 
  Nacional de Vigil&acirc;ncia Sanit&aacute;ria</i> (Anvisa - National Agency 
  for Sanitary Vigilance), created in 1999, initiated its activities according 
  this model. The public regulatory mechanisms responsible for registering technologies 
  and their approval for commercial use should, by definition, administer conflicts 
  of interest &#150; national economic interests, corporations, managers and professionals, 
  the population &#150; and there are frequent complaints relating to their decisions, 
  both in developed and underdeveloped countries.<sup>5</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is difficult to estimate the impact of progressively more
complex parameters for demonstrating the efficacy and safety of
technologies on population health. Information on the volume of
technologies considered potentially interesting to corporations,
but discarded along the way, are not public knowledge. At the
same time, scientific and technological developments have led to
the proposal of technologies, particularly medicines, with ever
growing scope to affect biological processes, making it difficult
to establish what is acceptable from the clinical practice and
ethics standpoints. The particularly critical stage is phase III
of clinical research, during which the product is near
commercialization. Despite growing methodological sophistication,
the determination of clinical efficacy and of the risk from
adverse effects observed during a limited period in thousands of
patients acting as proxies the population as a whole is always
susceptible to unexpected findings. Because of this, legislation
now seeks to append phase IV to clinical research (of
effectiveness and population safety) which will also be the
responsibility of corporations. The early identification of
unexpected risks and the design of corrective actions have not
been a simple undertaking since, during the process of launching
a product onto the market, the economic interests involved are
significant.<sup>15,18</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Technological evaluation in the area of health, as an
institutionalized activity, began in the 1970s and was pioneered
by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) of the American
Congress, created to produce independent studies on new
technologies for which new legislation would need to be proposed.
With time, this agency lost importance and authority and was
closed down at the start of the 1990s. Technological evaluation
as part of the health system was developed in Western Europe at
the end of the 1970s, notably those countries with public health
systems and universal coverage (Sweden, the Netherlands, and the
United Kingdom). In the beginning, they were dedicated to
producing data on the effectiveness and safety of new
technologies, primarily those of high cost. Notable among these
technologies were equipment, since clinical research procedures
were not as well-defined as they were for medications (a problem
that persists today). In time, the scope of information necessary
for new technologies increased, adding a dimension of (economic)
efficiency to the analyses. This constituted a complementary
vigilance mechanism of the public sector in the introduction of
new health care technologies. Recently, some countries have begun
to require cost-effectiveness studies for the approval of
medication, which thus constitutes a fourth hurdle for industry
to reach the market.<sup>53</sup> The principal challenge of
sanitary vigilance, in all countries, has been to carry out its
technical and legal activities with rigor and autonomy, without
transforming them into excessively expensive and heavily
bureaucratic rituals, and to occupy a clearly defined role in
economic, industrial, legal and health policies. This is not an
easy endeavor.<sup>8</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Incorporation and utilization: initial strategic diffusion;
much dissemination, little obsolescence</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once authorized, the technological use of products and
procedures in the health systems spread in a relatively slow and
restricted manner to the most, technically and financially,
relevant professionals. Frequently, these are specialists who
were already involved or followed the initially phases of this
technology. Generally, they have links with academia and are
important instructors and legitimators of opinions and practices
for health professionals and for the general
population.<sup>9,31</sup> This phase of more restricted use of
technology, both with respect to the type of patient and to
professional competence, has been decisive for its large-scale
dissemination in the health systems, which occurs when adequate
financial conditions are created.<sup>45,48</sup> In countries
that develop public sector mechanisms for this activity, it is
during this stage that technological evaluations of interest to
managers responsible for the regulation of its routine use in
services are developed. This is done through the definition of
criteria for access and financing.<sup>57</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These technological evaluations should produce knowledge
based, scientifically and methodologically, on effectiveness,
utility, benefit and efficiency, such that they assist managers
in choosing between existing alternatives. Hopefully, in this
way, the technical, ethical, political and economic dimensions
relating to the decision to incorporate and use technologies in
health systems can become better integrated. In the majority of
developed countries, mechanisms exist that are responsible for
the development of these evaluations, although the way they are
inserted into the health services system varies greatly (central
or regional, associated directly or indirectly with managers
responsible for decisions of incorporation and financing, type of
evaluation, and others). Their conclusions nearly always have an
air of recommendation, rather than approval or disapproval, and
thus they maintain close relations with research in health
services.<sup>40,43,49</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nearly all technologies approved for use in the systems are
disseminated, with varying levels of speed, intensity and
increase of use. The factors that influence the speed of
dissemination include: the type of technology (association with
diseases of higher or lower risk and social impact), medical
specialty to which it is linked, characteristics of the health
systems and policies, and the country's "culture". Thus,
mechanisms adopted by public authorities to guarantee the
controlled use of technologies have had an almost negligible
impact. This is reflected, beginning at the end of the 1990s in
nearly all countries, in the increase in health spending
associated with the persistence of inequality to access, use and
results of technologies.<sup>2,20,47</sup> It is evident in the
literature that the authors that study technological evaluation
in health come to defend the need for policies based on
"evidence", and concede the need to integrate the "technical" and
"political" dimensions of health care, and the participation of
managers, health professionals and the population (at all levels)
in the decisions to incorporate and use
technologies.<sup>14,19,44,56</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The discussion developed until now, by pointing to the
complexity of the processes relating to the introduction of new
health care technologies, contributes to the understanding of the
low impact of policies to inhibit, control or redirect its use.
These policies, however, seem to have had an impact that is less
defined and more difficult to measure for the professional
practices, of management and demands from the population, leading
to increased valuing of issues related to the routine use of
technologies. This leads to a scenario where extreme situations
are avoided. However, new challenges are continually appearing.
The development of biotechnology alters the models that have been
the basis until now of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and
can lead "medicalization" societies to become societies of
"biomedicalization". This process foregoes the standardization of
technologies and instead adopts a strategy of individualized
customization and will have repercussions that are difficult to
predict.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
