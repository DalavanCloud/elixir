<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations 
  Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS recommends that governments conduct periodic 
  analysis of actions undertaken in confronting the HIV/AIDS epidemic that involve 
  civil society's participation. Specific instruments and mechanisms should be 
  created towards this end. This paper examines some of the responses of the Brazilian 
  government to this recommendation. Analysis contemplates the Declaration's proposals 
  as to civil society's participation in monitoring and evaluating such actions 
  and their adequacy with respect to Brazilian reality. The limitations and potentials 
  of MONITORAIDS, the matrix of indicators created by Brazil's Programa Nacional 
  de DST/AIDS &#91;National Program for STD/AIDS &#93; to monitor the epidemic are discussed. 
  Results indicate that MONITORAIDS's complexity hampers its use by the conjunction 
  of actors involved in the struggle against AIDS. The establishment of mechanisms 
  that facilitate the appropriation of this system by all those committed to confronting 
  the epidemic in Brazil is suggested.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations 
  Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, which resulted from the United Nations 
  General Assembly. Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS), identifies, in its last 
  chapter, the need to follow up actions undertaken by governments in confronting 
  the epidemic. "Periodic analysis of the progress achieved in the implementation 
  of these commitments, conducted with the participation of civil society, in 
  particular, with the participation of people living with HIV/AIDS, vulnerable 
  groups and with those providing services", are suggested. The creation of "adequate 
  mechanisms of observation and evaluation, which make it possible to measure 
  and evaluate progress", are proposed as well as "appropriate instruments of 
  observation and evaluation, with adequate epidemiological data" and "supervisory 
  systems for the protection of human rights of people living with HIV".<a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of 
  follow up actions is to "identify the problems and obstacles that emerged when 
  undertaking commitments". The text also recommends "the widespread diffusion 
  of results".<a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IN 2002, a Joint 
  United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) consolidated a list of indicators 
  for governments to monitor actions.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  Although the Declaration contains broad target, such as "accelerating the execution 
  of national strategies for the eradication of poverty" or "developing political 
  strategies and programs related to the factors that make people vulnerable", 
  the indicators are specific for results with respect to the epidemic. These 
  indicators are associated in four categories: national commitments and actions; 
  knowledge and individual behavior; impact; and global commitments and actions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the same year (2002) the <i>Programa Nacional de
DST/AIDS</i> (PN-DST/AIDS) &#91;National Program for DST/AIDS&#93;
developed the <i>Plano Nacional de Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</i>
(PNA) &#91;National Evaluation Plan&#93; seeking to establish the
foundations for a continual process of monitoring and evaluation
of its actions. The matrix of the PNA is organized around the
dimensions of monitoring and evaluation. Indicators of impact and
results are defined for dimensions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2005, the <i>Plano 
  Estrat&eacute;gico do Programa Nacional de DST/AIDS</i> &#91;Strategic Plan of the 
  DST/AIDS National Program&#93; assumed that one of its directives would be "the 
  creation of an effective capacity for monitoring and evaluating", seeking to 
  improve of the program's management. Consequentially, the <i>Pol&iacute;tica 
  Nacional de Monitoramento e Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> &#91;Monitoring and Evaluation 
  National Policy&#93; was formulated, incorporating and updating the PNA. UNAIDS's 
  system of indicators was also revised in 2005.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  According to this revision, it was recommended that data be disagregated according 
  to sex and specific indicators be defined in function of the prevalence of the 
  epidemic in different countries. Mechanisms of establishing civil society's 
  participation were more detailed, including the production of qualitative and 
  quantitative data and access to the national plans for collecting data.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>PROPOSAL FOR 
  FOLLOWING UP THE DECLARATION OF COMMITMENTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The follow up activities set forth in the Declaration are
periodic analyses, observation, evaluation and supervision. While
recognizing the existing lack of consensus with respect to the
scope of each of these activities, it may be acknowledged that,
by and large, there is a certain <i>continuum</i>: periodic
analyses would provide the necessary information to respond
whether or not what was planned was in fact executed
(monitoring); evaluation would provide responses as to whether
what was planned and executed produced the desired results; and,
supervision would attempt to resolve the discrepancies between
what was planned and executed on the one hand, and, on the other,
the results foreseen and those attained.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering these four phases, it is possible to perceive that
following up the activities extrapolates the observation of the
behavior of an indicator during a limited period of time.
Observed variations should be interpreted <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>
the actions proposed, those that were effectively carried out,
the objectives set forth when the actions were proposed and the
circumstances that interfered, whether positively or negatively,
in attaining those results. This analytic and interpretive effort
should be undertaken, for each of the 64 targets set forth in the
Declaration, in partnership with civil society and people living
with HIV/AIDS. The follow up proposal is, consequentially, a
broad and complex target.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ADAPTING THE 
  UNGASS PROPOSAL TO THE BRAZILIAN CONTEXT</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Declaration 
  of Commitment was elaborated in midst of an intense and legitimate concern with 
  the negative impacts that the epidemic has provoked in the African continent, 
  and that it may provoke in Asia and Eastern Europe, where it is more recent, 
  if viable, alternative means of treatment are not found. Thus, the focus of 
  the Declaration is on countries or regions where there is a high prevalence 
  of HIV or where the epidemic is in a rapid phase of expansion and that do not 
  rely on a structured health system. In Brazil, the 0.6% prevalence is much lower 
  than that of some African countries, such as Botswana, with a 40% prevalence.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
  The epidemic has reached a phase of stabilization in Brazil, where there is 
  access to anti-retroviral treatment, and a long history of partnership with 
  civil society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While acknowledging the pertinence of the Declaration for
countries devasted by the epidemic, its directives should be
adapted to Brazilian reality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pioneering character of Brazilian DST/AIDS policies is
such that some of the principles that guide the Declaration of
Commitments have already been partially or totally contemplated.
This is the case, for example, in relation to the proposal of
intersectoral collaboration that is already contemplated in the
partnerships between the PN-DST/AIDS and other sectors of the
Ministry of Health, between this program and other Ministries,
such as the Ministry of Education, and other sectors, such as
private enterprise, by means of the Business Council. The same is
also true with respect to the integration between prevention and
assistance, one of the characteristics of the PN-DST/AIDS since
its creation, as is the participation of civil society in the
definition and accompaniment of its actions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the recommendation as to the "participation of civil
society", present in the Declaration, seems to be based on
realities distinct from the Brazilian reality, where it is still
necessary to remember that the greater the number of people
interested in this issue are directly involved, the easier it is
to find a solution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The engagement of Brazilian civil society in the struggle
against AIDS does not mean that the dialogue between the State
and the AIDS movement occurs free of tensions. On the contrary,
this is a live, intense process, that is continually
reconfigurating itself, with a constant flow of leaders from
civil society to the PN-DST/AIDS and <i>vice versa</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The characters denominated in the Declaration of Commitment as
"civil society" &#150; people living with HIV/AIDS, higher risk groups
and health care providers &#150; do not express the entire set of
agents that build the social arch surrounding the struggle
against AIDS in Brazil, which relies on several other actors,
including those who produce knowledge on the subject. The latter
should be specifically invited to participate in the monitoring
actions, due to their potential contribution in the
interpretation and analyses of data, redrafting of proposed
actions and dissemination of the analysis and results.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time, the utilization of fixed categories, such as
"people living with HIV" and "groups living under greater risk",
in order to define the subjects that should participate in follow
up actions, requires caution. Doubtless, these subjects have a
priviledged knowledge on habits, behaviors and language of their
community. Their contribution may be fundamental in drawing up
the strategies of prevention and care of their respective groups,
as well as in the analysis of data concerning the accomplishments
and shortcomings or obstacles arising from the implementation of
strategies. However, the incorporation of these capacities in
tasks that require the command of specific technical abilities,
such as the follow up program proposed by UNGASS, is a challenge.
Furthermore, the people that compose the groups defined in the
Declaration as "civil society" also identify themselves in terms
of social class, gender, ethnic and professional groups that also
mark their experience of living with HIV/AIDS or belonging to
some group under greater social exclusion. Thus, this experience
may not always suffice to leave specific marks on policies, even
if the subject was involved with their formulation and/or
implementation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The participation of people that are active in
non-governmental organizations in different government instances
or forums has been constantly problematised in the places where
civil society organizes itself. Questions are raised as to which
mechanisms may be utilized by people invited to compose a mixed
environment (government/society) in order to assure that their
opinions and perspectives in fact express the desire or reality
of their reference group. Or still yet, up to what measure the
opinions expressed in these forums are effectively brought to
bare.<sup>3</sup></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>PARTICIPATION 
  OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN MONITORING ACTIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monitoring their actions is among government's
responsibilities, being relatively easy to define the actions
that should be monitored and the method to be utilized towards
this end: a priority among the actions to be undertaken is
established, and in thesis, the same sequence is followed in the
monitoring process. Definition of methods and the respective
techniques utilized in collecting data is facilitated by
governmental organ's access to existing data systems and due to
the possibility, when these are not sufficient, of producing the
necessary information. Although the culture of monitoring and
evaluating health is relatively recent in Brazil, and the
systematic production of information is not a practice that has
been incorporated by health services, it is possible to establish
modes and criteria for accompanying the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These
modes and criteria may be the point of departure for evaluating
the pertinence and efficacy of actions implemented. In fact,
since the beginning of the epidemic, effort has been made, on the
part of the PN-DST/AIDS, to systematize and disseminate, by means
of its <i>Boletim Epidemiol&oacute;gico</i> &#91;Epidemiological
Bulletin&#93;, the information related to mortality due to this cause
and the notification of new cases of AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monitoring is a 
  very complex procedure for civil society. Producing quantitative data of a populational 
  character in order to accompany the behavior of the epidemic independently does 
  not make sense nor is it possible. Thus, one should rely on data produced by 
  the government to accompany actions that this same government defined in response 
  to the problems that it identified. Many of these actions can only be accompanied 
  by means of data provided by the government. Consequently, an effort must be 
  made so that civil society does not become a mere spectator of the process. 
  Apparently, the alternative proposed by UNGASS, is an effective partnership, 
  in which government and society define in conjunction, similar levels of expertise, 
  interest and commitment as well as the contents and strategies to be utilized 
  to keep track of the epidemic. Due to differences in these actors' political 
  perspectives, as well as differences as to their familiarity in handling the 
  data and in their individual and institutional disposal for the task at hand, 
  this alternative is not realistic. For this reason, in 2006, UNAIDS began to 
  suggest that civil society develop its own processes of monitoring, including 
  the production of qualitative data, that would make it possible to delve more 
  deeply in the analysis of quantifiable data.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The difficulty arising when civil society attempts to monitor
public policies is not only operational or political, it is also
conceptual. Often the idea of monitoring is confounded with that
of social control. Although it is not possible to conduct any
form of social control without some kind of monitoring &#150; for it
is this latter process that will supply the acts of social
control with their content &#150; these actions are distinct in their
dynamics and in their purposes. One example of how civil society
interlaces monitoring and social control is the way it responded
to the shortage in medication supplies that occurred in 2004.
Activists from different regions of the country developed and
applied a questionnaire in order to diagnose the quality of
assistance among HIV positive individuals, in an organized
manner. It was completed in only four months. The results were
disclosed to the public in mobilizations conducted simultaneously
in all the municipalities involved in the initiative, unleashing
actions of social control. Beyond the merits and political
interests of this initiative, the fact that the diagnosis
utilized was an instrument prepared by people living with HIV and
who rely on the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> (SUS)
&#91;Brazilian Unified Health System&#93;, permitted their experience to
be incorporated in the definition of criteria related to the
quality of assistance and satisfaction among individuals
utilizing SUS. In this manner, knowledge was appropriated from
people living with HIV for effective action in monitoring and
social control.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>SYSTEM FOR MONITORING 
  INDICATORS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PN-DST/AIDS's System for Monitoring Indicators
(MONITORAIDS) was created with the "objective of providing
partners and civil society as a whole, useful information that
makes it possible to accompany the Brazilian response towards the
control of AIDS and other STDs". It aggregates indicators
considered relevant for monitoring the HIV/AIDS epidemic as well
as other STDs; which are useful in evaluating the programmatic
actions of the <i>PN-DST/AIDS</i> as well as being suggestive for
future evaluations. The instrument is considered the "most
relevant structural component of the <i>Plano Nacional de
Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> &#91;National Evaluation Plan&#93;".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MONITORAIDS is 
  composed of indicators that attend the demands of UNGASS, the World Bank and 
  the PN-DST/AIDS itself. It is comprised of a set of socioeconomic, health indicators 
  related to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, originating from different databases and specific 
  research. There is an index card for each indicator, in which its definition, 
  the method utilized for calculating it and its limitations are explicited. It 
  is foreseen that the system will be updated and re-edited each year. MONITORAIDS 
  has been available on the internet since 2005.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The result of exhaustive work, MONITORAIDS presents the same
problems that any system of this stature tends to present,
considering that Brazil is a large, populous country that has
profound social inequalities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reports are presented in a national and regional sphere.
Indeed, it is up to the federal manager to present nationally
aggregated data, or regionally disaggregated data, since
important regional differences in terms of access and service
coverage, population morbimortality rates and living conditions
are well-known.<sup>2</sup> Regional differences and inequalities
also result in disparities in coverage and quality of
information, and specific methodological artifacts are necessary
to correct the data.<sup>1</sup> Aggregation of data, whether on
a national, regional or state level, by homogenizing distinct
realities, also produces a result that is quite distant from any
reality. The utility of this information for purposes of local
and immediate planning of health actions, including AIDS, is thus
compromised. In this sense, expliciting the limitations of each
MONITORAIDS indicator does not reduce the necessity of conducting
more specific studies, when the intention is to plan, monitor and
evaluate local actions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information issuing from SUS is not based on populational
studies. Some of the data systems are structured and supplied
information that is directed towards the payment of procedures,
this is the case, for example, of the <i>Sistema de
Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Ambulat&oacute;rias</i> (SIA)
&#91;Outpatient Information System&#93;<i>,</i> the <i>Sistema de
Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Hospitalares</i> (SIH) &#91;Hospital
Information System&#93;<i>,</i> the <i>Sistema de
Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre o Pr&eacute;-natal</i> (SIS
pr&eacute;-Natal) &#91;Pre-natal Care Information System&#93;, and
others. Thus, there is a margin of error when this data is
utilized for other purposes, since efforts may be made to adjust
the procedures undertaken to those listed in the payment rosters
and other distortions. Furthermore, the systems for payment of
procedures do not indicate how many people where in fact
beneficiaries. In this way, the limitations of these sources of
information may be greater than indicated in MONITORAIDS, when it
states that data originating from SUS does not cover the entire
population and all health procedures. Finally, creating
compatibility with respect to information that originates from
distinct sources is not always possible, since the fields covered
and the methodologies utilized in collecting data may be
different.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The databases related 
  to health assistance and administration have the above mentioned limitations; 
  the systems related to the epidemiological profile, such as the <i>Sistema de 
  Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es em Mortalidade</i> (SIM)&#91;Mortality InformationSystem&#93;<i>,</i> 
  the <i>Sistema de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es em Agravos Notific&aacute;veis</i> 
  (SINAN) &#91;Notifiable Disorders Information System&#93;<i>,</i> and the <i>Sistema 
  de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es sobre Nascidos Vivos</i> (SINASC) &#91;Live Births 
  Information System&#93;, present problems with respect to coverage. For example, 
  the national average for the underregistration of deaths is estimated at 20% 
  and reaches a 40% average in Northern and Northeastern regions. Approximately 
  15% of the death declarations within the SIM database do not present the basic 
  cause of death; as to SINASC, its estimated converage in the Northern and Northeastern 
  regions is 75%; and the SINAN has not been implanted in all Brazilian municipalities.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some data derives from research whose replication or
preriodicity is not guaranteed. This is the case, for example, of
the <i>Pesquisa Nacional por Amostragem de Domic&iacute;lios</i>
(PNAD) &#91;National Survey Based on a Residential Sample&#93;, that is
irregular in terms of its periodicity and presents a specific
content at each edition; and the <i>Pesquisa Nacional de
Demografia e Sa&uacute;de</i> &#91;National Survey on Health and
Demography&#93;. Even the Demographic Census has occasionally
presented problems of periodicity. However, despite some delays,
these surveys do end up occurring. Guaranteeing periodicity is
more troublesome with respect to the evaluation studies and
surveys conducted by PN-DST/AIDS that depend on specific
resources, political will power and available funds both within
the Program and the Ministry of Health. Furthermore, it should be
stressed that these studies are the only ones that provide
information concerning the characteristics and behavior of
certain populations, being essential, therefore, for planning
actions.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reflection concerning the monitoring of government actions in
the struggle against AIDS presupposes that this is a political
process, although it relies on technical instruments for this
purpose.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, it is possible to approach the process of monitoring
from a technical perspective, attempting to reduce its political
dimension. This seems to be the Brazilian government's option up
to the present.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As proposed by UNGASS, instruments and mechanisms were created
in order to conduct periodic analyses that make it possible to
evaluate progress and identify obstacles. The effective
incorporation of distinct social actors in this task, however,
needs to be further developed. This includes building strategies
for further appropriation and utilization of MONITORAIDS, as well
as the establishment of mechanisms to facilitate the process of
production and circulation of information by civil society. It is
also necessary to stimulate the capacity for analysis and
critique of information by the broad set of activists committed
to the struggle against the epidemic. The more consolidated the
partnership between civil society and government in accompanying
the epidemic, easier it will become to conduct effective actions
for its control.</font></p>
