<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study was intended to assess care provided to those
living with HIV/AIDS in Brazil and the Brazilian Unified Health
System (SUS) capacity of delivering interventions to cope with
the epidemic as well as to discuss the sustainability of the
Brazilian initiative of providing universal free access to
antiretrovirals (ARVs). Original data from a study comprising 119
respondents on the potential capacity of delivering a prospective
HIV vaccine in Brazil was used. Inpatient and pharmaceutical care
was based on data from the SUS Hospital Information System and
Drug Logistics Management Systems of the National Program for
STD/AIDS. The study results indicate good performance of the
Brazilian ARV Access Program but access to treatment of
opportunistic infections was, however, unsatisfactory. The rates
covered by SUS for AIDS hospital admissions remained very low, on
average around R$700 in 2004. Health care to HIV/AIDS patients
has been considered a citizen's right strongly supported by an
effective joint action of the Brazilian government and civil
society. The current challenges are fine monitoring of processes
and program results and ensuring sustainability of universal free
ARV access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Care, Support 
  and Treatment principle of the United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  addresses two main points. First, strengthening health care systems for safely 
  and effectively providing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and best care recommended 
  for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections, including actions 
  on drug practices and policies that would allow a sustainable ARV provision. 
  Second, developing and progressively implementing comprehensive strategies for 
  care and support, including psychosocial support, to those individuals, families 
  and communities living with HIV/AIDS, on a family or community basis or at the 
  level of health care services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The commitment 
  agreements endorsed for 2003 and 2005 have already been incorporated to the 
  guidelines developed by the Brazilian government. The Brazilian Health System 
  first provided drug for opportunistic infection treatment in 1988, and zidovudine 
  became available in 1991.<sup>3,4</sup> In 1996, the government took a groundbreaking 
  step and pioneered passing a law establishing as the State's responsibility 
  to provide universal free drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  In addition, the National Program for STD/HIV/AIDS (PN-DST/AIDS) has been historically 
  characterized by taking thorough care measures and incorporating comprehensive 
  strategies to fight against the epidemic and having a central role in promoting 
  joined action with civil society.<sup>2,7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Measuring the achievement of the established targets goes
beyond the simple formal verification of their attainment. It
poses challenges that indicate the need for finer monitoring of
processes and results of care provided to those living with
HIV/AIDS concerning drug therapy, and health services utilization
as well as attention at the community level. It also raises
questions on quality of care provided through actions of a
distinctive National Program, unique in many aspects but still
relying on the Brazilian care system undermined by serious
operational problems. Ultimately, it brings about issues on the
government agenda on how to assure sustainable drug access
programs to those living with HIV/AIDS given their rising
costs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While most issues outlined above still need to be further
explored and appraised, some have already been studied. HIV/AIDS
outpatient care was assessed in a study conducted in seven
Brazilian states &#150; Par&aacute;, Maranh&atilde;o, Cear&aacute;,
Rio de Janeiro, S&atilde;o Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul and Mato
Grosso do Sul &#150;, in 2001 and 2002 and recently published by the
QualiAids Project group.<sup>9,10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study intended to further address other aspects of
care provided to those living with HIV/AIDS in Brazil, including
an overall assessment of the health system capacity to fight the
epidemic; a descriptive outlook on hospital admission rates in
the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in recent years; and an
input on the impact and sustainability of universal free access
to ARVs.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>SOURCE OF DATA 
  ANALYZED</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data were collected from several sources, and unpublished
results are presented as well as previously published results
from other studies and documents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The overall assessment of the capacity for implementing
interventions on HIV/AIDS is based on original data from a 2005
research study on the potential capacity for providing a
prospective anti-HIV vaccine in Brazil, as proposed by the World
Health Organization (WHO).<sup>1</sup> Data were collected from
interviews with 119 subjects, including managers of the
PN-DST/AIDS, local and state representatives of STD/AIDS program,
representatives of non-governmental organization (NGOs),
investigators, and HIV/AIDS health providers. A total of 12 HIV
interventions were evaluated and their scores ranged from 0 to 10
and comprised items such as prophylactic treatment to HIV exposed
health providers, access to primary and secondary prophylactic
treatment to opportunistic infections, access to opportunistic
infection treatment and effective population-based HIV/AIDS
treatment programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hospital and drug 
  care aspects included in the Brazilian ARV access program intertwine when analyzing 
  data from SUS Hospital Information System (SIH)<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  and the PN-DST/AIDS Drug Logistics Management System (SICLOM).<sup>6</sup> HIS 
  data comprise all admissions in public and private (contracted and philanthropic) 
  hospitals covered by SUS at national level and include variables such as demographic 
  (age and gender), clinical diagnosis and those related to health services utilization 
  (length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, procedures).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When SUS costs, 
  hospital admission rates and patients receiving ARVs were addressed, some results 
  presented here are from joined historical series data from the above mentioned 
  sources, obtained from the PN-DST/AIDS Indicator Monitoring System (MONITORAIDS).<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  However, hospital admission approvals (AIH), which are the SIH observation units, 
  do not allow for differentiating inpatients from day hospital patients. Also, 
  it was not possible to identify duplicated registries of ARV patients in SICLOM.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were also used SIH data from AIDS AIH issued between
January and December 2004, selected based on the variable
"procedure performed": AIDS treatment; AIDS patients receiving
long-term care; and AIDS care in day hospital. Inpatients were
differentiated from those receiving day hospital care in these
analyses. When SICLOM database was used directly, there were
analyzed data on the longitudinal follow-up of 42,058 patients
during the period between January 1998 and March 5, 2003,
enrolled in 54 of 485 HIV/AIDS drug provision units available at
that time. After controlling for multiple registries, SICLOM
included 102,582 patients enrolled during this study period, but
only 42,058 patients had data on drug provision.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CAPACITY TO 
  FIGHT THE EPIDEMIC</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29430t1.gif">Table 
  1</a> shows the results of the assessment of the capacity for implementing interventions 
  on HIV/AIDS. Specifically, the last items are focused in the aforementioned 
  principle of the UN Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS: prophylaxis and HIV 
  exposure of health providers; access to primary and secondary prophylaxis to 
  opportunistic infections; access to opportunistic infection treatment; and implementation 
  of effective HIV/AIDS treatment national programs. Although means are slightly 
  low because of several very negative evaluations, medians indicate relatively 
  favorable evaluations, especially concerning the implementation of effective 
  HIV/AIDS treatment national programs (median = 8). Of the four aspects highlighted, 
  access to opportunistic infection treatment had the poorest evaluation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though ARVs are provided by SUS services, SICLOM includes
treatment registry data from both public and private sectors,
which allowed to estimating that 90.5% of patients actually
receive care in SUS. This finding puts into context the
counterpoint between hospital admission rates and costs covered
by SUS and ARV provision, which pervades the following
results.</font></p>

  showed the lowest mean cost per hospital admission in this period (<a href="#fig3">Figure

  in 1998 to R$700 in 2004. The highest mean costs were seen in the Northern and

  ACCESS TO ARVs</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/html/en_29430t3.htm">Table 
  3</a> summarizes some relevant facts on universal free ARV access program in 
  Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groundbreaking policy on HIV/AIDS in Brazil raises
questions that now go beyond the simple achievement of the
targets established in the 26th Special Session of the United
Nations General Assembly. Having achieved these goals beforehand,
challenges are posed for finer monitoring of processes and
results of care provided to those living with HIV/AIDS.
Differences in these processes and results should be further
explored and understood in order to identify strategies that
could effectively increase the existing gains. There is also a
need to further knowledge on adverse effects of ARVs for
providing timely effective responses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interiorization and pauperization of AIDS epidemic in
Brazil represents a challenge and calls for the results attained
in main urban centers to be extensive to all other regions and
social segments. Brazil should be involved in discussions on the
utilization of intervention models based on more practical and
less complex technologies that will ensure satisfactory results
in health settings with less developed infrastructure that are
not easily accessible to different populations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While compliance 
  to ARV therapy is 75%,<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>5</sup></a> which 
  is consistent with that seen in developed countries, it is imperative to find 
  new ways of scaling up actions for compliance promotion through improving health 
  services, building up capacity of multidisciplinary teams and supporting joined 
  activities of health services with local community.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Improving quality of care provided by a distinctive National
Program for STD/AIDS, unique in many aspects, but that relies on
the strengthening of Brazilian care system in all levels, should
be a concern. The Brazilian health care system is undermined by
serious operational problems and several different local
realities, many of them below the desired care
standards<i>.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HIV/AIDS outpatient care comprises services with heterogeneous
settings and infrastructures that mostly are in easily accessible
areas and have the minimum required resources. In their study,
Melchior et al.<sup>9</sup> reported that 74% of all outpatient
care units had at least one infectious disease specialist
available and 90.4% had at least one non-medical provider, and
76% of health teams consisted of a social worker, a nurse, a
psychologist and a pharmacist. The majority of health units had
in place referral mechanisms to direct patients to other
specialties within the SUS. However, some specialty services
require long waiting hours, and referrals to pneumologists,
neurologists, eye specialists and general surgeons are the most
troublesome. CD4 and CD8 counts and viral load tests as well as
regular laboratory tests and X-rays were available in more than
95% of services but there was increased difficulty in having
access to more complex testing, especially imaging tests. ARVs
were consistently highly available, contrasting with low access
to other drugs for opportunistic infection prophylaxis and
treatment, which are distributed by local and state governments.
In regard to health care organization, Melchior et al<sup>9</sup>
stressed below desired levels of professionalization in service
management, inadequate operation with limited service hours,
limited use of care protocols, inexistent systematic evaluations
of processes and results, lacking meetings of health care team,
and poor control of visit no-shows and patient withdrawal, either
due death, dropouts or others. On the other hand, these authors
emphasize as positive widespread pre- and post-testing
counseling, strongly supported by the PN-DST/AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian drug 
  program for HIV/AIDS is characterized by universal free access to ARV therapy 
  and a consensus among Brazilian experts to recommend the use of ARV therapy 
  and opportunistic infection prophylaxis and treatment. This practice follows 
  current internationally recommended evidence-based clinical guidelines and these 
  recommendations are periodically updated and disseminated nationwide.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The positive impact of a comprehensive health care program to
those living with HIV/AIDS in Brazil is patent. Studies reported
significantly improved survival rates of those living with
HIV/AIDS.<sup>8,12</sup> On the other hand, where as the absolute
rates of HIV/AIDS hospital admissions remained stable in the
period between 1998 and 2004, the number of those receiving ARVs
was significantly reduced, indicating an increase in patients on
therapy, early diagnosis, higher survival rates and, ultimately,
improved general health condition of these patient.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Translating reduced hospital admission rates in economic terms
is strongly appealing but this is prevented by the very low SUS
coverage. Assuming in 2004 the same hospital admission rates of
ARV patients as in 1998 and mean cost of R$ 700 per admission, it
can be roughly estimated that, in 2004, more than 57,000
admissions were prevented, a saving of approximately R$ 40
million to SUS. It should be noted, however, that these figures
do not provide a measurement of efficiency of ARV access program
in Brazil, to be determined through a careful economic
evaluation. Effectiveness data, translated into increased
survival and quality of life, are much more compelling. Moreover,
it should be emphasized, no demerit, the decision to implement
such program was essentially political, grounded on the
perception of it as a human and legal right of Brazilian
population, strongly supported by the joined action of the
PN-DST/AIDS with local and state authorities and the organized
civil society.<sup>2,7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for sustainable access to ARV therapy, the UN Declaration
of Commitment on HIV/AIDS recognized the need for reducing ARV
costs and the impact of free trade agreements on local essential
drug manufacturing on the development of new drugs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian government 
  has been making efforts to ensure sustainable universal access to ARVs now provided 
  to around 170,000 people at an annual cost of about US$450 million. This program 
  comprises strategies of national manufacturing of non-patented drugs, negotiating 
  prices with drug companies and playing a role internationally for changing regulations 
  on intellectual property and access to drugs.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a> 
  Between 1997 and 2004, there was a 4.6 time reduction in the mean ARV treatment 
  cost, from US$6,2 to 1,300.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, since 2005, the declining cost trend has changed. The
Brazilian Ministry of Health estimates significantly increasing
mean treatment costs due to a proportional reduction of first
line drug use, which are locally manufactured and have an average
cost of about US$600 per year per patient, and increased second
line therapies, all imported and patent protected. ARV import
currently accounts for 80% of government ARV budget and this
situation tends to be aggravated if TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects
of Intellectual Property Rights) flexibilities will not be put
into practice and compulsory licensing will not be granted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An agreement signed by the Brazilian government and Abbott
Laboratory by the end of 2005 further aggravates the current
situation, setting Kaletra<sup>&reg;</sup> price for the next six
years and committing the Brazilian government not to apply for
compulsory licensing of any ingredients of this drug. The annual
drug cost of US$1,380 per patient is too high, and even higher
than US$500 paid by other countries, such as South Africa. In
short, while ARVs are freely provided, their costs are becoming
unsustainable and threatening the PN-DST/AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the generic AIDS drug program adopted by Brazil
is based on strengthening public laboratories for allowing them
to develop other drugs essential to public health. But
uncoordination between national public drug manufacturers'
efforts, development of new technologies and research promotion
have aggravated in recent years despite considerable investments
by the Ministry of Health on infrastructure and equipment.
Consequently, combined to slow rigid administrative and legal
bureaucratic bidding processes, in 2004 and 2005, there was ARV
undersupplying, projects for new drug development were delayed,
including those drugs associated at fixed doses, and the
sustainability of the PN-DST/AIDS and quality of care provided to
those living with HIV/AIDS were jeopardized.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, International Trade Agreements are not
compatible with public health needs of Southern hemisphere
countries for research promotion, technological development,
strengthening of national industries and universal free access to
health services. In Brazil, in addition to the fact that there is
no properly defined strategy for research and development,
international laws have deterred reverse engineering for
developing second line drugs and, hence, the national drug
industry. Local governments have not taken any actions to
guarantee compliance with Article 68 of the Industrial Property
Law, which determines that drugs can be locally manufactured
three years after they have been registered.<sup>3</sup> The
government has not either applied TRIPS flexibilities favoring
the local industry. All ARV cost negotiations conducted by the
Ministry of Health with patent holder multinational drug
companies produced lower price agreements. However, these
agreements did not include provisions concerning technology
transfer and voluntary licensing and thus have not been an actual
encouragement to local public and private drug manufacturers.
Brazil has actively been involved advocating that free trade
agreements under negotiation should not include restrictive
provisions concerning intellectual property, referring to TRIPS
agreement and Doha Declaration as the highest commitment with
intellectual property issues. Internationally, Brazil has also
headed a so-called movement "Friends for Development,"
questioning the impact of patents on drug research and
development and access to drugs in the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO). Brazilian and Argentine leadership
contend to prevent the implementation of patent agreements under
negotiation as they would jeopardize the sovereignty of
developing nations.</font></p>

created by the Bidding Law 8.666,<sup>5</sup> which determines
rotation of producers providing raw material to government
laboratories and hinders the registry of drugs as generic. This
is so despite adequate bioequivalence evaluations and proper
local regulations for registry and control of locally
manufactured drugs, including an actively involved National
Agency of Health Surveillance (ANVISA).</font></p>
