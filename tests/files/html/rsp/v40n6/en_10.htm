<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To investigate and analyze the discourse of students living in university residence 
  halls regarding socialization processes and drug consumption.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> This was qualitative research among 20 undergraduate students 
  living in university residence halls in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, 
  in 2003. Residence halls were taken to be socialization spaces for young people 
  that enable the presence of low-income students at university. The interviews 
  covered students' knowledge of the history of the residence hall, their experience 
  of living in student residences and their perceptions regarding drug consumption. 
  The methodological procedure that served as the basis for collection, organization 
  and analysis of the interview data was examination of the collective discourse 
  of the subjects.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> It was shown that the students had little knowledge of the history 
  of the residence hall; solutions for problems they faced in the residence hall 
  were sought individually; and the two main concepts observed among the people 
  living there for preventing drug consumption were war on drugs and damage limitation. 
  It was seen that there was a negative view regarding student residence halls 
  that related to the constant publication of disturbing events and lack of knowledge 
  of the importance of residence halls for enabling poor students to remain at 
  university.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> In the opinion of the people living in student residence 
  halls, such accommodation enables access to university, despite the difficulties 
  in living together and in administration by the university. With regard to the 
  use of drugs in the residence hall, some of the people living there emphasized 
  the need for less tolerance towards drug consumption, while others stressed 
  the importance of educational work, particularly among those who are just starting 
  to live there.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the world, young people started rushing into higher
education in the 1950s. By the following decade, these people
formed a group with political expression that acquired social
visibility.<sup>11</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of Brazil, middle-class young people started to
have greater access to university in the 1960s. Until then,
university had been the privilege of the rich.<sup>10</sup> But
it was only in the final years of the twentieth century that some
access to higher education institutions for the lower classes was
seen, restricted to around 10% of young people.<sup>19</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking a sociological reading of the contemporaneous
dissemination of drug consumption around the world would lead to
the belief that this was associated with the clear condition of
merchandise that drugs have taken on from capitalism.<sup>3</sup>
Consumption would come to "meet" the needs, which would go from
placating anxieties that originate from situations of insecurity
in which the mechanisms of trust and certainty have been
weakened, to reproduction of values that today furnish the basis
for life within society &#150; competition, individualism and
hedonism.<sup>20</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Epidemiological studies on drug consumption among university
students have been characterized by their descriptive and
multifactorial nature, with a concern for establishing which
drugs were used most, the patterns of use, the factors that might
lead to their use, the profile of users and attitudes towards
consumption. Studies conducted among university students have led
to the belief that living far from the family would increase the
chance of using drugs.<sup>2,7</sup> Such an association is
particularly delicate, considering that it could assist in
maintaining the stigma that living in student residence halls
means having a liberal attitude towards drug consumption or even
being a user.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association between the variables of student housing and
drug consumption deserves deeper investigation to broaden the
understanding of the meaning of living in university residence
halls or experiencing the sociability of youth under such housing
conditions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The few qualitative 
  studies relating to the theme of "drugs and university students" have suggested 
  that changes in sociability and socialization patterns are capable of affecting 
  the frequency of marijuana consumption.<sup>16</sup> For students of health-related 
  subjects, the university environment stimulates abusive consumption of alcohol, 
  which is seen as fashionable and a sign of maturity, thereby causing isolation 
  of those who have contrary attitudes.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the field of prevention, two approaches can be
highlighted: war on drugs and harm reduction. Each of these
approaches receives feedback from a set of theories and practices
that go from explaining drug consumption to sets of preventive
strategies.<sup>20</sup> Harm reduction fits in with the
reference points adopted for the present study, emphasizing the
need to put drug consumption within the circumstances of the
means of production and the specific contexts produced by such
consumption and within which such consumption takes place. In the
war on drugs, which is an imperialistic mechanism of domination,
consumers are persecuted and the weight of behavioral change is
placed on them by using the methods of prohibition and
terrorization.<sup>20</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The importance of the present investigation lies in: 1) the
absence of scientific studies on student housing; and 2) the
importance of such housing as a socialization space that
democratizes the access to university for many students.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the aim of contributing towards preventing the harmful
consumption of drugs among young people, the objective of the
present investigation was to analyze the perceptions of
university students living in residence halls regarding drug
consumption, as mediated by socialization processes within the
specific context of student housing.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study was conducted in the municipality of S&atilde;o
Paulo in 2003, in a university residence hall belonging to the
State of S&atilde;o Paulo. This was a qualitative study of
exploratory nature that empirically attained its objective by
means of individual semi-structured recorded interviews. The
itinerary for the interviews was as follows: knowledge of the
history of the residence hall; description of what it was like to
live in the residence hall; participation in social, political,
leisure or sports activities in the residence hall; weekend
activities; perceptions regarding the use of drugs in the
residence hall; opinion about drug users; stance adopted towards
the set of ideas put around that residence halls are an
environment that favors the use of drugs; suggestions for facing
up to the problem of drug consumption in that location.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The total number of residents officially registered was 1,348
(970 undergraduates and 378 postgraduates). The residence hall is
composed of seven blocks named A to G, each with six floors and
11 apartments per floor. Each apartment is designed for three
students. There is no charge for the accommodation and it is
destined for undergraduate and postgraduate students at the
university who are regularly enrolled and have gone through a
selection process at the start of each year. This process
produces a classification based on an assessment of the student's
socioeconomic level that is made by social workers from the
university's social promotion division. At the end of each year,
the students are reassessed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the students living in the hall, it was found that 37%
were aged between 22 and 24 years, 96% were single and 95% had no
children, 54% had some type of study grant (including trainee
schemes), and 88% had an income of between one and two minimum
wages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The snowball interview technique was utilized. This made it
possible to obtain better reception and availability from
interviewees in relation to the investigation, since the
investigator could in some manner be presented to the
interviewee.<sup>6</sup> As the interviews were conducted,
interviewees were asked to nominate another female or male
colleague for interviewing, according to the quantity of
interviewees of each sex obtained up to that time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was a concern to interview undergraduate students (equal
numbers of the two sexes) who had lived in the different blocks
that make up the residence hall for more than one year. This
information was obtained from the resident profile records that
are kept by the institution that administrates the hall. These
records served as the basis for making up the sample. In an
attempt to reflect the heterogeneity of the residents, and
respecting the general recommendations for qualitative research
regarding theoretical saturation, 20 interviews were
undertaken.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The operational procedure that served as the basis for
collecting, organizing and analyzing the material was collective
discourse of the subjects,<sup>15</sup> while also utilizing
Bardin's recommendations for thematic analysis.<sup>4</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Collective discourse is a set of methodological procedures
that has the aim of organizing the verbal material into the form
of syntheses of the discourse relating to the different ideas of
a given group of subjects. In this way, to find out what a given
social group thinks about a certain topic, it is necessary to
access each individual's own words and group them according to
similarity or complementarity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the end of this procedure, the investigator unified the
discourse from the various key expressions with the same meaning.
This discourse was grouped into three broad categories: what the
residents said about the history of the residence hall; what it
was like to live in the residence hall; and the residents'
opinions about drug consumption.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interviewees showed that they had little knowledge of the
history of the residence hall, but some recalled, in the manner
of talking about myths, that its origin might have been connected
with possible accommodation for athletes in Pan-American games
that did not take place because of an epidemic that was also
somewhat uncertain. The words of many interviewees reflected
knowledge of the struggle of the student movement, relating this
to a tumultuous history and making reference to the conflicts
that would herald the start of the stigma that marks the
residence hall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The residents emphasized that living in the hall made it
possible to be at the university.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>Here you're able to manage your money very well because,
as well as the accommodation, you have support in the form of the
food grant and work grant. Another thing that also changes (...)
is your consumption pattern. I think it would be very different
if I was living in my city and studying here. For example, I'd
think twice about going into a bookshop and spending 30 reais on
a book, and I went to the cinema &#91;for the first time&#93;, here at
the university</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The exceeding of expectations regarding living together in the
residence hall seemed to depend on encountering people who,
contrary to the stigma put about, were "normal", could hold
conversations, tidied up the home, made food and lived their
daily lives. Disappointment with living together was attributed
to the individualism of students who did not have any collective
spirit, "even if they were studying humanities".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sociability patterns of these young people were seen to be
abnormal because of the isolation they were subjected to at
weekends. Few were able to visit their families with any
frequency, and loneliness was indicated as the consequence of
this isolation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>I think it's very strange that you end up being isolated.
You end up starting to live in a world apart, because there are
different rules and different customs, and you joke that you're
in a bubble, an island, even in a zoo, because everything is so
organized, and you leave thinking that society is really like
this. There are fewer advantages than in those closed
condominiums in the classical sense, but this matter, this
detachment from social reality&#133; it's the fact that you
suddenly&#133; when you leave, it takes a certain time to realize
that unemployment exists and that people don't have money to buy
such things</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The alternatives for facing up to the problem of loneliness
and isolation varied from transforming the apartment into a
convivial space, to organizing a variety of leisure activities
that could constitute opportunities for socialization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are rules in the residence hall, but they do not need to
be complied with. This excess of liberty accompanied by lack of
authority was not seen solely as a positive feature. It was
pointed out that the consequence was failure to learn to respect
public spaces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apparently, the students do not have anyone to turn to, to
sort out problems in the residence hall. The management is slow
in resolving matters like electricity or water failures, and is
also omissive in relation to drug trafficking.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>And another 
  thing is clear, I'm not saying that we're innocent in this story &#150; there 
  are drug dealers here because people buy the stuff &#150; but it's a heavy matter. 
  We feel that certain complicated things happen here mainly &#91;because of&#93; these 
  drug dealers that we know are here. It's like it's something that's kind of 
  in the corner: a subject that no one talks about, so they keep quiet as if it 
  would sort itself out. The residence hall appears to be free because of these 
  things: because on the administration's side we get the impression that they 
  don't do anything and because of ourselves who let these things happen</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students considered that society has a very distorted view
of the residence hall and the people living these, and there is
prejudice even within the university.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>Everyone already has an idea of student housing. People
already say that any type of student housing is a mess, with
riotous living and goodness knows what else. But people say a lot
about what they don't know about, because when I came to live
here, they painted a picture for me of a totally horrible place
that I would be afraid to come and live in. But as soon as I came
here, I saw what it was like and got rid of this view completely.
&#91;Today&#93; I don't think that it's such an open matter to say that
everyone who comes into here uses drugs: I don't see anything of
this (...)</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To understand the theories presented by the students for
explaining the drug consumption, the material was organized by
aligning their words to the two major contemporary currents: the
war on drugs and the harm reduction movement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>The people who use drugs here in the residence hall are a
bit strange: things get kind of heavy around them, I think. But
then it's more difficult: there are other people that I thought
were really great and who started to use drugs. Then they stopped
studying properly: they use marijuana and don't study so much.
They were very intelligent and now they just mess around. &#91;Now in
general, there is the question&#93; of weakness that arises: wanting
to experiment, going there, trying it and not managing to get
out. It's not always the person's fault: there are some that we
know are really stupid, who go there because it's cool and think
it's the thing to do, but there are people who go there through
pure innocence (...)</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the prevention strategies situated within the field of
the war on drugs that were mentioned, it was noted that some of
the students took an incisive stance against any use of
drugs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>First, what's done in society as a whole &#91;should be done&#93;,
because however much they want it to be, the university is not
outside: it is not an entity that is independent of society; it
is within society. &#91;The problems&#93; are reduced only by having
policing inside it &#91;the residence hall&#93;, by pulling everyone out
and really making a rigid inspection. Imprisonment is a legal
response for this type of practice</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the field of concepts conforming to the harm reduction
movement, the discourse was less reductionist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>(...) It seems that sociability necessarily passes through
drug use, which is an interesting thing. It's not right or wrong,
but it's at least interesting how sociability occurs: it
necessarily has to pass through drugs. &#91;With regard to&#93; the
university itself, it is very, very empty in questions of
relationships, questions of interpersonal relationships &#91;it's
like this&#93; here in the residence hall. People who use drugs tend
to deepen this here, if only because you've got to study and
switch off. Sometimes it seems that you're a bit forgotten
here</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was possible to characterize a series of suggestions from
the students regarding how to proceed in the light of drug
consumption, in alignment with the concept of harm reduction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>I think there needs to be greater debate regarding
individuality: about how people really perceive drug use and how
this affects people's lives, whether this consumption is in their
families or their own. That's how the work should be started, so
that drug use is reduced and drug trafficking is weakened. Today,
drug trafficking has really become as highly profitable
business</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was considered that activities should be developed with new
arrivals:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>But for newcomers it's advice, but not like don't take
drugs &#91;because&#93; drugs are an evil monster. It's to show how
harmful they can be at the start of that person's course, if he
gets involved in drugs and doesn't know what he's doing. In this
sense I think it's OK to get advice because many people start in
some way and don't know what to do, and they lose the year or the
semester: in this sense. &#91;So&#93; I think that one of the things
would be to create activities for welcoming freshmen and creating
a more convivial atmosphere (...). The activities &#91;could be&#93;
cultural, especially with freshmen. Such as trying to create an
environment, a style of sociability that does not necessitate
&#91;drugs&#93;, in which passing through drug use is not really
needed</i>".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was also a suggestion that the university should make
access to treatment and support available for dependent students
who want help. The suggestion was that there should be investment
in publicizing the reality of the residence hall from the point
of view of those who require such accommodation to turn their
studies into reality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the more tolerant side, a considerable proportion of the
students recognized that drug consumption did occur in the
residence hall, but did not cause them any problems. The problems
with drug consumption were put into relative context through the
acceptance that there were different types of users and that not
all of them had problems with drug use.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the residents' factual and fragmented knowledge of
the history of the university residence hall related to its
origin, they did not know the details of this history, its
location at the heart of more general events in the country and
the political implications. It was known that the history of the
residence hall was marked by students' demands and struggles,
troubled by deaths and invasions, but it was not known what role
the university had in this process. One important analysis
presented by the students spoke of a possible relationship
between the troubled history of the residence hall and its
present negative image.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students considered that, despite the problems, the
residence hall fulfilled its main function, which is to make
university courses possible for poor students and those who live
far from the university.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the problems presented by the students is that the
public university offers the minimum needed for the students to
have somewhere to live, while the structural problems that place
difficulties on access to the residence hall and on students'
daily lives are not presented for discussion and solution. This
relationship between the residents and the university reflects
the broader social dynamics that are governed by the laws of the
market, which confer the status of merchandise on university
education and other rights.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">University residence halls help in democratizing the
university by making life easier for students who have gotten
round the neoliberal capitalist scheme and, even being poor, have
managed to get into a good-quality public university.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the young people who break through the class barrier and
get to university, the impact of experiencing a new reality from
a cultural point of view is much greater than the impact from the
material taught in the classrooms. This paradox is presented to
the extent that it might give rise to unreal bedazzlement.
Students coming from wealthier classes have had the opportunity
to gradually go on building up this cultural repertoire, which
makes this experience part of a process started at an earlier
stage.<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students also raised the problem of leisure activities in
their daily lives in the residence hall, which seemed to be
sporadic for many of them. Leisure activities have been little
studied and are even perceived as secondary in academic studies,
even though "leisure activities for young people (...)
&#91;constitute&#93; an especially important space for developing
relationships of sociability and the searches and experiences
through which they seek to structure their new references and
their individual and collective
identities<i>".</i><sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They also raised the difficulties that the residents had in
living together, with predominance of individualism in their
relationships. Once again, this is a broader social question,
since this the main form of relationship between people
today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students also mentioned that they suffered prejudice
because of living in the residence hall. In turn, they showed
that they were prejudiced against drug consumers. Generalizations
coming from the media, which has taken on the task of throwing
light on the explosive negative events regarding the residence
hall and its residents, and those coming from the so-called "law
of least effort" that characterizes these people's daily lives,
are mechanisms that induce prejudice.<sup>14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of drug consumers, the category "drugged" is
utilized as an accusatory category that in itself comprises a
whole range of negative factors, in which those accused are
morally repugnant and might threaten the status
quo.<sup>22</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The perception that the residence hall was not responsible for
drug consumption among the people living there was present in
many students' words. A variety of explanations for why people
started using drugs were given, which did not necessarily relate
to the residence hall. The residents formed a heterogeneous
group, since they came from different cities, states and
countries, and this was reflected in the views on drug use and
users and in their suggestions for smoothing out the possible
resultant problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the one hand, there was conservative and repressive
discourse containing proposals to restrain freedoms and severely
punish drug users, thereby putting the blame on them for the
problems stemming from drug use. The strategies of the war on
drugs have not even reduced the criminality rates,<sup>23</sup>
and the maintenance of this policy constitutes a form of
imperialistic domination of Latin American
countries.<sup>12</sup> Moreover, "the hostility and fear
triggered facilitate the intensification of social control,
expansion of the State's power to punish and, simultaneously, the
weakening of the democratic rule of law".<sup>13</sup> The media
has collaborated in building up a veritable state of panic among
the Brazilian population, by carrying alarmist information on
illegal drugs, while the drugs most used by the population are
alcohol and tobacco.<sup>18</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand, the opposite position was shown in the
discourse of students who recognized the importance of putting
drug use into context and taking a relativistic overall view.
These students put forward prevention proposals that started from
knowledge of the users' realities, with the aims of overcoming
prejudice and promoting a wider social debate. Velho<sup>21</sup>
emphasized the importance of putting matters into context and
stated that generalizations have only contributed towards placing
stigma on users.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students perceived the relationship between drug
consumption and socialization processes in the residence hall.
Generally, the first contact with drugs takes place during social
activities, party situations, barbecues and meetings of
friends.<sup>5</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several authors have pointed out the need for universities to
rethink their role. Chau&iacute;<sup>9</sup> reported on the
consequences in universities of neoliberal ideology that proposed
to decrease public spaces and expand private spaces.
Foracchi<sup>10</sup> pointed out universities' submission to
technological society, with opposing groups of interest that did
not have any commitment towards culture, while principally
concerned with trading their products.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One important suggested presented by the students, which would
be a viable alternative in the search for solutions for the
problems experienced by residents was the conducting of
scientific research that would deepen the knowledge of the
residence hall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the prevention proposals presented by the residents
are in line with the presuppositions of harm reduction
strategies, thereby suggesting educative actions of an
emancipatory nature.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The wider social debate suggested by residents is a step that
analysts in this field have emphasized. This debate could also
contribute towards understanding the roots of the problems among
young people today and favor the development of a public project
for young people at university, who seems to be fragmented and
absorbed by "postmodern values"<sup>8</sup> of discontinuity,
indetermination and discredit of utopias.</font></p>
