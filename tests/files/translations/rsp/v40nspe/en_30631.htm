<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The differences in health between men and women have been
object of great interest, but interpretations tend to be
naturalized and essentialists. Gender-oriented studies have
criticized this literature and offered new analythical
alternatives. The present study was intended to describe the
profile and trends of scientific production on gender and health
in Brazil. Data sources comprised the Research Groups Directory
of <i>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e
Tecnol&oacute;gico</i> (National Research Council), CAPES
(Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)
Thesis Bank, and four journals available in SciELO - Scientific
Eletronic Library Online. Fifty-one groups with at least one line
of research in the subject were identified, with regional and
institutional concentrations. The results confirmed the marked
growth of scientific production in this field as 98 master and 42
doctoral dissertations and 665 articles on gender and health were
retrieved. Women authored 86.0% and 89.0% of doctoral and master
dissertations respectively, and 70.5% of the articles. Most were
published in the 2000s when diversification of the studied topics
was also seen. The studied subjects can be divided into five
subgroups: reproduction and contraception; gender and violence;
sexuality and health with emphasis on STD/AIDS; work and health,
including domestic and night work; other emergent or less
explored topics. There are major political, epistemological and
methodological challenges for strengthening these advancements.
The gender perspective offers possibilities for enlightment of
theoretical dilemmas in public health. Furthermore, it can be
added to other intellectual and political efforts towards
understanding health and its determinants and fighting against
inequalities and for social justice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a long time health differences between men and women have
been naturalized following so-called neutral biological theories.
Many authors have sought to show these differences derive from
gender conceptions where "man" is regarded an universal model of
human being and "woman" as the "other", special, deviant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The notion of two biological sexes only emerged in the
eighteenth century<sup>57</sup> when reproductive organs were
differentiated linguistically and acquired absolute centrality
for establishing differences between men and women. Women became
seen as more fragile and vulnerable to all kind of influences,
whether physical, moral or intellectual, due to an alleged
sensibility that made them especially suited to
motherhood.<sup>77</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The maternal-infant perspective has prevailed in biomedical
literature, where women have been represented as mothers or
potentially pregnant.<sup>56</sup> In this sense, scientific
production has been guided by the reproductive aspects of health,
privileging the health of the unborn.<sup>60</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1970s, with the growth of the "second wave" of
feminism,<sup>64</sup> a systematic critique of essentialism and
of androcentric bias in the sciences initially focused on
exposing women's invisibility and highlighting the manner in
which subjects directly related to women's experience had been
obscured, such as housework and marital violence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Early studies investigating 
  "woman" &#150; an empirical category &#150; were replaced by "gender" studies 
  &#150; an analytical category that rejected the biological determinism of sexual 
  differences and emphasized the social construction of female and male.<sup>52</sup> 
  In the 1990s, men were included as an empirical category and an approach questioning 
  hegemonic masculinity models was joined to the efforts deconstructing essentialism. 
  This developing field<sup>4</sup> also drew on the studies of sexuality, that 
  were legitimated by the need to cope with AIDS pandemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has been an ongoing paradigmatic transition from studies
about "women's health" to studies about "gender and health". This
transition translates into the superpimposition of concepts,
ideas and theories and mixes up terms like "women", "gender",
"female", and "feminist", each of which has very specific
meanings: "A 'woman' is a particular individual; 'gender' denotes
power relations between the sexes and refers to both men and
women; (...) 'feminine' refers to women's idealized mannerisms
and behaviors in particular periods and settings, potentially
exhibited by men; and 'feminist' defines a political standpoint
or agenda".<sup>82</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Gender" is a grammatical term borrowed by Anglo-Saxon
feminists and alludes to the social organization of the relation
between the sexes.<sup>86</sup> A pronounced increase in the use
of 'gender' in English titles is noticeable in the Web of Science
interface of the Institute for Scientific Information
(ISI)/Thomson database. This can be attributed to its adoption by
academic feminism after 1970.<sup>48</sup> Before then, its
non-grammatical use was rarely seen and "sex" was used to make a
distinction between men and women. At first, the term "gender"
spread without restricting the use of "sex". But, by the end of
the 1980s, "sex" became increasingly circumscribed to defining
sexual behaviors and practices: anal, vaginal and oral sex, safe
sex, sex workers, among others.<sup>48</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use of the term gender by academic feminists began in the
1960s.<sup>48</sup> But, it was Rubin<sup>79</sup> in 1975 who
proposed a sex/gender system defined as: "(&#133;) a set of
arrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex
and procreation is shaped by human, social intervention and
satisfied in a conventional manner".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The original influence of political economy and the Marxist
inspiration have been replaced by an emphasis on identities and
on the "cultural construction" of sexual
differences.<sup>42</sup> This has entailed strong debate as
different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives confront each
other, reflecting tensions between modernity and postmodernity.
The critique of universal theories and of dualisms, such as
nature and culture, on which the proposition opposing sex to
gender was based, has destabilized this concept and given rise to
many controversies. Poststructuralist and postmodern lines of
thought have challenged the very material basis of sex, claiming
that it was gender that created sexual difference as a
classificatory system ordering the world.<sup>20,57</sup> This
debate is ongoing and will not be presented here as it is highly
complex; however, its richness has profound implications for
thinking about health and disease.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides feminism's direct influence on academic settings,
organizations such as the Pan-American Health Organization have
promoted the institutionalization of a gender perspective in
health research and public policies,<sup>46</sup> although not
free of conceptual distortions. Its generalization has often
voided the concept's heuristic strength by reducing it a
description of differences between men and women, as a mere
replacement of "sex".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Problems increase in the context of Romance languages, as the
terms used to denote "gender" lack sexual meaning. These terms
usually allude to the idea of classification, either as literary
style or school, or as a taxonomic unit in the field of biology.
In Brazil, this polysemy has implications for the mapping of
scientific production. As a result, it is necessary to exclude
articles where gender was used in this sense. The impact of the
gender perspective in health research has still to be
investigated and is beyond the scope of this article. The present
study aims at beginning to explore this emerging thematic field
by profiling and describing trends of scientific work on gender
and health in Brazil.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>MAPPING THE 
  FIELD</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information was 
  collected from the directory<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  of the <i>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico and Tecnol&oacute;gico</i> 
  (CNPq - National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) to investigate 
  lines of research. This directory gathers more than 80% of active groups in 
  Brazil.<sup>47</sup> Groups identified in the updated database (version 5.0) 
  as of 5/4/2005 showing at least one line of research in the subject field studied 
  were included. Data on field of knowledge, sex of researchers and group heads, 
  date of creation, institution and country region were collected. The definition 
  of the search keywords &#150; "gender and health," "women's health" and "sexuality" 
  &#150; was based on the historical development of the subject field. Other keywords 
  such as "men's health," "reproductive health," and "feminism" did not add any 
  further information for defining research groups in collective health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To assess scientific 
  production two data sets were studied. In the first set, doctoral theses and 
  master dissertations were identified from the <i>Coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o de 
  Aperfei&ccedil;oamento de Pessoal de N&iacute;vel Superior</i> (Capes - Coordination 
  for the improvement of Higher Education Personnel) bank of theses.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>**</sup></a> 
  Abstracts have been included in this bank on an ongoing regular basis since 
  1987, and the reference date for search was 3/6/2006. Data on study title, year 
  of submission, program, author's sex, institution and country region were collected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the second set, 
  four periodicals were explored: <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> 
  (RSP), published by <i>Faculdade de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica da Universidade 
  de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> (FSP-USP) and it is the oldest journal in the field 
  (since 1967); <i>Cadernos de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> (CSP), published 
  since 1985 by <i>Escola Nacional de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica da Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  Oswaldo Cruz</i> (ENSP-Fiocruz); and <i>Ci&ecirc;ncia e Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i> 
  (CiSC) and <i>Revista Brasileira de Epidemiologia</i> (RBE), both created by 
  the <i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de P&oacute;s-Gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  em Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i> (Abrasco - Brazilian Association of Collective 
  Health Postgraduate Programs) in 1996 and 1998 respectively. All articles from 
  these periodicals available between 1980 and 2005 in SciELO (Scientific Electronic 
  Library Online),<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>***</sup></a> a virtual 
  collection for online access of scientific periodicals, were studied.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CSP and RBE were explored from their creation; CiSC was
explored between 2000 and 2005 as this was the time period
available in the database; and RSP was explored from 1980 to
2005, the entire study period. The terms "gender", "woman", and
"sexuality" were investigated in all search fields (title,
abstract, and keywords). The study comprised a quantitative
assessment of titles per year, first author's sex, and a
qualitative assessment of subjects, through the selection of
articles representing new trends and approaches.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INSTITUTIONALIZATION 
  OF A NEW FIELD OF STUDY IN BRAZIL</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazilian academic production has been influenced by feminism
from its early days but it was only in the 1980s that the first
centers for women's studies were created at Brazilian
universities, inspired by the Women's Studies American
model.<sup>25</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 1980s, propositions presented at national meetings
on health, sexuality, and reproductive rights contributed to be
the creation of the <i>Programa de Assist&ecirc;ncia Integral
&agrave; Sa&uacute;de da Mulher</i> (PAISM - Comprehensive
Women's Health Care Program). But feminism's influence in
academic work began to be noticed only in the next decade with
the creation of the first focal points on "women's health",
parallel to the emergence of gender studies in human
sciences.<sup>52</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Research groups on gender and health</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study search 
  identified 131 research groups in 18 fields of knowledge with at least one line 
  of research in "gender and health". Most are in collective health (28.2%), totalizing 
  34 groups (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Due to historical reasons, selecting 
  this single keyword &#150; "gender and health" &#150; leaves out part of academic 
  production in this subject field (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). For this reason, 
  27 groups were identified based on "women's health", of which only 48.7% included 
  "gender and health"; 22 showed "sexuality" (77.3% of them had also "gender and 
  health"). By adding up these three keywords, a total of 51 groups were found, 
  38.1% having lines of research exclusively focusing on gender and health, nine 
  showing "gender" in the title and eight showing "women's health". The remaining 
  had generic denominations of collective health or referred to subjects such 
  as violence, work, and healthcare. This reflects the way the institutionalization 
  of gender studies has proceeded in Brazil, with a search for legitimacy by integrating 
  them into the dynamics of the scientific community and through the avoiding 
  of "ghettos" in alternative areas.</font></p>
<p><a name="fig1"></a></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30631f2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, female involvement in research groups has been
strong (73.3% of researchers and 73.8% of students) and most
groups are headed, though not exclusively, by women (67.3%).
However, 65.5% of groups had a second head, of which 80.5% were
women, which may suggest that the gender hierarchy of academic
work organization has been reproduced even in this field,
originally influenced by feminism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies were mostly 
  concentrated in certain Brazilian regions, reflecting a general trend of Brazilian 
  scientific activity: 56.6% of groups were from the Southeastern region, almost 
  all from Rio de Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo; 22.6% were from the Northeastern 
  region and 17.0% from the Southern region. A closer examination revealed that 
  four leading institutions &#150; <i>Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> (USP), 
  <i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Oswaldo Cruz</i> (Fiocruz), <i>Universidade Federal 
  da Bahia</i> (UFBA), and <i>Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro</i> (UERJ), 
  together house a total of 23 groups (45.0%).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Groups on gender and health in collective health were largely
established in the 1990s (43.6%), at first in the Southeastern
and Northeastern regions, and, after 2000, when another 23 groups
(45.5%) were established in all regions, except for the
Midwestern states. This trend partially reflects the sustained
development of collective health<sup>47</sup> but also the
influence of factors favourable to this thematic field, which
require further analysis cannot be discussed here.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For now, it can be stressed that short- and intermediate-term
teaching programs have been joined to research scholarship
programs providing dozens of young researchers with education in
this field nationwide.<sup>4</sup> These initiatives have been
supported by international associations, in particular, the Ford
Foundation. The Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology,
through CNPq, and the Ministry of Health, through the Department
of Science and Technology, have recently announced funding for
research on a variety of aspects that may be grouped under the
headings "women's health" and "men's health," thus favouring ther
scaling up and legitimizing of scientific production on gender
and health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The institutionalization of this field is also noticeable by
the regular presence of scientific activities in specialized
events. These have gained visibility since 1995 with the creation
of the <i>Grupo de Trabalho G&ecirc;nero e Sa&uacute;de</i> (Task
Force on Gender and Health), which works together with Abrasco's
executive board.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Scientific production on gender and health in
Brazil</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Academic production on gender and health in Brazil has not
been limited either to collective health or to the larger domain
of health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Stricto sensu</i> graduate programs have produced 686
master's dissertations and 222 doctoral theses including the term
"gender" associated to "health" and/or "sexuality" from 1987 to
2004. These studies covered almost two dozen different fields of
knowledge, but the studies were mostly concentrated in
psychology, education, nursing, social sciences and collective
health. The latter had 98 dissertations and 42 theses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first doctoral 
  thesis to include gender in its title was submitted in 1992, proposing that 
  gender would be applied in the study of women's mental health<sup>95</sup> &#150; 
  paradoxically still an underexplored subject under this perspective. Most studies 
  had been examined from 2000 (75% of theses and 70% of dissertations), a time 
  when this subject field enjoyed its greatest growth. Following the same trend 
  as the research groups, 74% of academic work in collective health on this subject 
  area was developed in the ambit of four institutions &#150; Fiocruz (28.6%), 
  USP (21.8%), UERJ (12.8%), and UFBA (10.5%). These institutions provided the 
  graduate programs (master's degree and doctorate) that are most highly rated 
  by Capes, including two rated at level 6 (UFBA and Fiocruz) and four at level 
  5 (USP, UERJ, and Fiocruz).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Publications on gender and health in the collective health
area</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an interdisciplinary field, collective health integrates
different cultures of producing and disseminating its scientific
production. Published in the periodicals studied, the production
in question is also found dispersed in national and international
publications of various related areas, as well as in books and in
technical publications. For this reason, the present study
covered part of this production, albeit that which is most
disseminated because electronically available. A thoroughgoing
assessment is not intended, but rather the aim is to address the
most representative Brazilian scientific production concerning
the theme under scrutiny. Exceptionally, some landmark books
making available collections of articles will also be cited.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the four periodicals 
  studied, from 1980, 665 articles on the subject were published, 11.6% of all 
  articles published (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30631t1.gif">Table</a>). RSP published 257 
  (38.6%) articles on gender and health, 11.5% of all published articles in this 
  journal between 1980 and 2005. A growing trend was seen from 2000, notably in 
  2005, when these subjects were covered in more than 25% of articles published 
  in RSP. A 2002 supplement included articles focusing on different aspect of 
  "HIV prevention in the context of social vulnerability".<sup>71</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CSP had the highest absolute number of articles, the
equivalent of 49.8% of all publications on gender and health and
13.6% of all articles published in CSP. A characteristic is the
inclusion of a variety of subjects, especially through the
publication of three supplements. The first CSP supplement,
published in 1991, focused on "Women and health",<sup>43</sup>
strongly criticizing the maternal-infant perspective; the second
one (1998) addressed "Reproductive health in Latin
America",<sup>50</sup> and the third one (2003) dealt with
"Gender, sexuality, and reproductive health".<sup>4</sup> In
addition to these three, other supplements on work, violence and
inequalities included articles with a gender perspective.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given their shorter 
  life, the two Abrasco journals &#150; CiSC and RBE &#150; had a minor contribution 
  to the body of articles studied. However, CiSC has recently published a supplement 
  entitled "Man as public health focus", including extensive reviews on the subject.<sup>85</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The publishing of supplements not only reflects a response to
social needs in this field but also an editorial board's
responsiveness to emerging subjects or to subjects overlooked by
"normal science". The practice clearly contributes to the
dissemination of new ideas, concepts and approaches.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who has published on gender and health</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As in other fields of knowledge, it is women themselves who
are producing academic publications on gender. They have authored
most studies, 86.0% of theses and 89.0% of dissertations in this
field, and they were the main authors in 70.5% of 665 articles on
gender and health studied. This somewhat reflects the increasing
representation of women in collective health, but it could also
be explained by factors intrinsic to the development of the
gender and health field. Noting the same phenomenon with respect
to production on gender in the social sciences, Heilborn &amp;
Sorj<sup>52</sup> offered some interpretations that may apply to
collective health: "On the one hand, this reflects the weight of
the prestige hierarchy between the sexes on the ordering of
scientific objects and scientists; on the other hand, it shows
that the strong association between gender studies and women's
movements hinders male researchers' involvement".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Men are more likely to be authors in two instances: first, in
studies with a maternal-infant
perspective,<sup>1,12,59,88,89</sup> especially those published
in the 1980s, and then afterwards, in the emerging field of
masculinity studies<sup>14,39,40,45</sup> and, to some degree, in
studies concerning AIDS and sexuality<sup>49,63,76</sup> in the
1990s. But the unique article on feminist theory and medical
sociology<sup>23</sup> was written by two male authors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What the scientific production is about</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the first half of the 1980s, a maternal-infant approach
prevailed, and 75% of the articles focused on pregnancy, delivery
and breastfeeding.<sup>21,89,92</sup> Maternal mortality, later
incorporated to the priority agenda of the feminist movement and
the health sector, began to be investigated<sup>88</sup> at this
time, though still from a clinical epidemiological view aiming to
identify a profile of causes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A remarkably original and groundbreaking study by
Barroso<sup>13</sup> (1984) opened the discussion on female
sterilization from a feminist perspective. It also anticipated
this subject's inflection from "conception" to "contraception"
starting in the second half of 1980s as a consequence of
dramatically reducing fecundity rates among Brazilian women. From
then, there has been increased interest in contraceptive methods,
including reversible methods, abortion, and tubal
ligation.<sup>29,55,93</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reproduction &#150; 
  and its opposite, contraception &#150; has started to be investigated from "women's" 
  perspective, an empirical category that would later be included in studies on 
  epidemiology and health care in Brazil supported by PAISM.<sup>26,70</sup> This 
  comprehensive view expanded the scope of health issues addressed in all life 
  cycles, including cancer<sup>8,62</sup> and high blood pressure,<sup>91</sup> 
  though still circumscribed to reproductive life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A collection on "Mulher, sa&uacute;de e sociedade no Brasil"
(Women, health, and society in Brazil),<sup>58</sup> (1989) and
the CSP supplement on "Mulher e sa&uacute;de" (Women and
health)<sup>43</sup> (1991) illustrate this new view. Both dealt
with so far overlooked aspects, such as work<sup>16</sup> and
violence.<sup>66</sup> New subjects have emerged, such as AIDS in
women,<sup>54</sup> Cesarean section delivery,<sup>38</sup> and
abortion.<sup>61</sup> An article investigated sex differences in
mortality that contributed to increased survival of Brazilian
women.<sup>7</sup> This same approach is recovered in the first
article to include gender in its title and addressing sex
differences in morbidity and health care utilization.<sup>5</sup>
It discussed the apparent paradox described in the international
literature that was also seen in Brazil: although women live
longer than men, they have worse self-rated morbidity and use
more health services, which reflects the high medicalization of
female reproductive cycles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1990s, there was extensive scientific production on
abortion, a controversial issue requiring a complex
methodological approach but highly valued by the feminist
movement. Early studies focused on giving it more visibility by
describing users' profiles<sup>41,51,83,94</sup> but later more
complex population-based studies were published,<sup>69,90</sup>
and introduced gender relations as practice
determinants.<sup>28,37</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A noteworthy publication is the CSP supplement (1998) on
"Sa&uacute;de reprodutiva na Am&eacute;rica Latina" (Reproductive
health in Latin America)",<sup>50</sup> which first discussed the
dilemmas of assisted reproduction, including articles on
reproductive health care and the major issue of female
sterilization. The link between religion and reproductive health
was addressed in one of its articles<sup>53</sup> and two of them
dealt for the first time with the role of men in reproductive
health.<sup>40,96</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A year later, another collection also focused on
"Quest&otilde;es da sa&uacute;de reprodutiva" (Issues in
reproductive health)",<sup>44</sup> and reviewed concepts such as
sexual and reproductive health and sexual and reproductive
rights, and problematized notions like 'the body' and
medicalization and the role of health services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The expansion of AIDS brought sexuality firmly onto the
agenda, giving rise to numerous articles, including an RSP
supplement<sup>71</sup> with emphasis on vulnerability. It
discusses the impact of HIV infection on sexuality and
reproduction, and topics such as masculinity and vulnerability,
and youth and AIDS prevention. Also, teenage pregnancy has
legitimated the study of sexuality, discussed in a recent
article.<sup>3</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relationship 
  between gender and work has been explored throughout the study period but production 
  has been scarce and centered in two institutions: Fiocruz,<sup>16-18,78</sup> 
  and UFBA, through its two research groups &#150; <i>Programa de Estudos em G&ecirc;nero 
  e Sa&uacute;de</i> (MUSA - Gender and Health Studies Program)<sup>6,9</sup> 
  and <i>Programa de Investiga&ccedil;&atilde;o sobre a Sa&uacute;de do Trabalhador</i> 
  (PISAT- Program of Environmental and Worker's Health)<sup>80,81</sup> in the 
  <i>Instituto de Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i>. On this theme, some epidemiological 
  studies exploring the link between gender and health stand out, as does an update 
  on breastfeeding from female workers' perspective.<sup>75</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Violence is another 
  subject that has been studied throughout this period but scientific production 
  on the topic actually increased in the 1990s. The link between violence, gender, 
  and health has a huge potential for deconstructing biological essentialism, 
  an important issue to feminism. Early studies sought to render more visibility 
  to violence in domestic and family settings<sup>31</sup> and in health services.<sup>32,84</sup> 
  Researchers also called attention to the role of health services in generating 
  another kind of violence &#150; so-called institutional violence &#150; which 
  even occasioned the publication in Lancet of one of the few articles of international 
  repercussion.<sup>30</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to its exceptional character and its potential of opening
up new frontiers of investigation, the use a gender perspective
in the study of endemic transmissible diseases, such as
schistosomiasis<sup>65</sup> and hanseniasis<sup>68</sup> should
be highlighted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The variety of subjects and issues addressed in two
publications<sup>4,11</sup> from the Interinstitutional Training
Program of Research Methodology on Gender, Sexuality and
Reproductive Health is typical of the first half of the 2000s,
when there has been a profusion of titles. This period is
illustrated by a growth of studies on health
evaluation,<sup>2,24,33,35,36,67,72,74,87</sup> and bioethics and
gender.<sup>34</sup> Further developments were seen in the field
with studies linking subjects such as violence and
pregnancy,<sup>22</sup> HIV/AIDS and sterilization,<sup>10</sup>
AIDS death and maternal deaths,<sup>15</sup> sexuality and
sterilization,<sup>94</sup> and paternity and
childcare.<sup>19</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mapping of the field of gender and health undertaken here
confirms the remarkable growth of scientific production in this
field, in particular in the last five years. Roughly, the
subjects can be divided into five subgroups: reproduction and
contraception; gender violence and its variants, like domestic,
family, marital and sexual violence; sexuality and health with
emphasis on STDs/AIDS; work and health, including housework and
night work; and other emerging or underexplored subjects such as
aging and mental health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A large number of empirical studies can now be recorded.
However, there is a scarcity of theoretical and epistemological
production directed to understanding not only gender relations,
as these affect health, but also their impact on the production
of scientific knowledge about health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some early factors have hindered the introduction of the
gender perspective in collective health, especially the influence
of marxism with its emphasis on social class for explaining
social inequalities. But the intense politicization of this field
beside a strong critiique of the neutrality of science, alongside
an unquestionable commitment to social change, have contributed
to the legitimization of the subject area. These factors play
different roles in the sub-fields of social sciences in health,
epidemiology, and health planning and policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evidently, most production has been in social sciences in
health, privileging a gender approach as a cultural construction
and making use of qualitative strategies. Methodological choices
reflect Brazilian social sciences' qualitative approach tradition
but they also derive from the understanding held by many feminist
researchers that quantitative methods cannot capture the
complexity of gender relations and their effects on different
levels of social life, notably health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This likely explains the weak penetration of this perspective
in epidemiological studies combining the use of quantitative
methods and the influence of biomedical sciences in defining
objects of interest, which has always been a resistance factor in
the gender field. In other words, epidemiology has investigated
clinically defined diseases, reserving social theories for
studying its determinants. In social epidemiology, the
predominance of social class as an explanatory category of
inequalities has resulted in the relative impermeability to
incorporating categories such as gender, race/ethnicity and
generation. It is still common to consider age as a "biological
factor" and to refuse to recognize race as a social construction,
since its biological base has been deconstructed by genetics.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gender has been incorporated as an empirical "politically
correct" category to replace sex and at the same time this has
has voided the meaning feminist theories attribute to it. This
reduction limits the potential for a broader explanation of
social dynamics, i.e., it prevents exploring gender as "a
principle of social organization".<sup>52</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The smallest production with a gender perspective can be
observed in health planning and policies, except in recent health
evaluation studies, most of which concern women's health. The
"noble" subjects in this sub-field, such as health care models,
social control and movements, power relations and health sector
structure, have been little influenced by a gender perspective.
In human sciences a similar lower penetration of the perspective
is apparent in political science, when compared to anthropology,
sociology, and history.<sup>73</sup> One can speculate that the
same gender conceptions that define politics as a male world also
rules over the science devoted to its study. However, the
distancing of gender studies from the original influence of
political economy towards a culturally constructed approach, with
a concominitant privileging of identity issues,<sup>42</sup> may
have contributed to this gap as well, due to inadequate
theorization of these subjects. Aiming at changing this scenario,
Abrasco's Task Force on Gender and Health developed initiatives
such as a seminar in partnership with the <i>Asociaci&oacute;n
Latinoamericana de Medicina Social</i> (ALAMES - Latin American
Association of Social Medicine) on "Health, equity and gender" in
1999. The seminar produced a collection where this relation is
explored from different angles.<sup>27</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are huge political, epistemological and methodological
challenges for further strengthening the advances made. The
profusion of titles and the great diversity of issues addressed
make any panoramic review incomplete and insufficient. There is a
need to summarize each subthematic issue of this literature to
better assess lacunae and directions for investigation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From an ethical standpoint, this field has considered such
potentially challenging issues as sexuality, sexual violence, and
abortion. These are intimate and private issues, sometimes
involving secrecy and illegal activities, the ethical aspects of
which have methodological implications and vice-versa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is much to be done from a theoretical viewpoint. Two
main challenges arisein this respect. First, there are
difficulties involved in integrating knowledge produced by the
biomedical sciences with that produced by the social sciences.
This is because, when investigating a huge range of health
issues, despite the need for denaturalizing the phenomena of
interest and disclosing the gender representations that guide
knowledge production, biological aspects cannot be treated
exclusively in their symbolic and cultural dimensions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another challenge concerns the transversalitly of gender and
the need to articulate this analytical category to others, such
as race/ethnicity, social class, and generation. A gender
perspective provides extensive possibilities for further
enriching theoretical reflection in collective health. It could
be joined with other intellectual and political efforts aiming at
understanding health and its determinants in the fight against
inequalities and for social justice.</font></p>
