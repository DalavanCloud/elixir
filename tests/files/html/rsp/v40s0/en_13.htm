<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of this study was to analyze, on the national
level, the process of monitoring the proposed UNGASS indicators
through the use of the Brazilian National Program for STD/AIDS's
indicators. Two groups of proposed indicators were analyzed in
2002 and 2005 respectively, as part of the monitoring of the
progress of the UNGASS Declaration of Commitment. The
availability of information and limitations in calculating the
proposed indicators in Brazil were analyzed and the
appropriateness of the indicators for monitoring the epidemic in
Brazil was discussed. Of the 13 quantitative indicators
originally proposed by UNGASS, five were not included in the
National Program. One was not included due to its qualitative
nature. Two of the indicators were considered to be of little use
and two were not included due to the lack of available data
needed for their calculation. As the epidemic in Brazil is
characterized as being concentrated, within the second group of
proposed UNGASS indicators those that refer to the accompaniment
of epidemic among high-risk population groups were prioritized.
The study highlights that the National Program concentrates its
efforts in the development, adaptation, and sharing of sampling
methodologies for hard to reach populations. Such activities are
geared towards estimating the size of vulnerable population
groups, as well as obtaining more information regarding their
knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The study concludes that by
creating the possibility of international comparisons between
advances achieved, the proposal of supranational indicators
stimulates countries to discuss and make their construction
viable. In a complementary way, the national monitoring systems
should focus on program improvement by covering areas that permit
the evaluation of specific control and intervention actions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monitoring and evaluation of health programs are increasing in
importance among health sector administrators and officials.
These activities constitute an essential stage in the planning of
actions geared towards guaranteeing quality in health care
attention.<sup>5</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monitoring and evaluation directed at management are focused
on the production and use of information to improve the programs
evaluated by integrating purely analytic and management
activities.<sup>3</sup> The main focus is to characterize a
condition using measures that can be quantified and repeated. The
quantitative methodology is predominant, although instruments
with a qualitative approach that can be standardized may also be
used.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As such, health program evaluation requires choosing relevant
characteristics or attributes to ensure that the approach to the
problem is viable from a methodological point of
view.<sup>13</sup> In this process, there are important stages
involving the definition and construction of indicators that
allow the monitoring of programmatic actions and subsidize
decision-making. The objective of evaluation is to propose the
establishment of criteria or norms to be used as indicators to
monitor the object being evaluated.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the indicators 
  are well formulated, are part of a monitoring and evaluation plan, and are interpreted 
  within the external contexts and organizational realities they can relevantly 
  contribute to the establishment of an efficient and effective Program. The efficiency 
  consists in the capacity of the program to reach its proposed results with the 
  smallest amount of resources, and the effectiveness, in the capacity of the 
  program to reach its results.<sup>7,<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1">1</a></sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June 2001, 189 countries, including Brazil, adopted a
Declaration of Commitment about HIV/AIDS, agreed upon during the
26<sup>th</sup> Special Session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations (UNGASS). This declaration reflects the global
consensus regarding the slowing down of the AIDS epidemic by
2015.<sup>12</sup> In an effort to monitor the progress of the
Declaration of Commitment, UNAIDS proposed a group of indicators
at the national and supranational level that should be filled
out, periodically, by the countries who signed the
declaration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of the present study was to describe the process
of monitoring the indicators proposed by UNGASS at the national
level, relating them to the indicators of the Brazilian National
Program for STD/AIDS.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>SYSTEM FOR THE 
  MONITORING THE (PN-DST/AIDS) NATIONAL PROGRAM INDICATORS: MONITORAIDS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The revitalization process of the monitoring and evaluation
activities within the National Program was incentivized,
especially, by the third loan agreement (AIDS III) between Brazil
and the World Bank. During this process, it was understood that a
fundamental strategy would be the development of a group of
indicators to monitor the epidemic and Brazilian response to
HIV/AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this context, 
  the National Program developed an Indicator Monitor System of the National DST/AIDS 
  Program (MONITORAIDS). The system was developed in a partnership initiative 
  with the <i>Departamento de Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es em Sa&uacute;de do Centro 
  de Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o Cient&iacute;fica e Tecnol&oacute;gica</i> &#91;Department 
  of Health Information in the Scientific and Technology Center&#93; (DIS/CICT) of 
  the Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Oswaldo Cruz and the Centers for Disease Control 
  and Prevention, Global AIDS Program Brazil (CDC/GAP-Brazil). This system meets 
  the promise of the National Program to offer partners and society as a whole, 
  helpful information that facilitates the accompaniment to the Brazilian response 
  to control AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD). MONITORAIDS is 
  a system of information available on the PN-DST/AIDS website in Portuguese, 
  English, and Spanish.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The development of the MONITORAIDS indicators followed the
following principles: be relevant to monitor the HIV/AIDS and
other STD epidemics; be useful in the evaluation of programmatic
actives of the National Program; and suggest aspects to be
evaluated in the future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Social factors constitute fundamental elements in the
determination of the morbity-mortality population standards. In
addition to this, a large difference in socioeconomic classes
also exists in relation to the utilization of health services in
Brazil. Keeping these aspects in mind, it is necessary to
consider the equity question as one of the central principles of
the monitoring systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From a monitoring and evaluation standpoint, the system is the
most important structural component of the <i>Plano Nacional de
Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> (PNA) &#91;National Evaluation Plan&#93;
(NEP). It adds information not only about the technical
components of the program, but also gives a dimension to the
equity component and integral nature of the Brazil Unified Health
System (SUS). The analysis of these indicators constitutes an
indispensable strategy to making adjustments for the improvement
of the Program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, MONITORAIDS presents 95 indicators. Depending on
the availability of information, the indicators are broken down
by: Region, Federal Units, age, sex, and a variable that
characterizes socioeconomic class, which allows the analysis of
these inequalities. For each indicator, there is a corresponding
indicator profile, directed at the following aspects:
definition/interpretation; objective; classification according to
the monitoring categories; classification according to the PNA
categories; calculation method; data source; possibility of
analyzing the equity dimension; limitations; period of time; date
of revision.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regards to 
  monitoring, the indicators are categorized in three dimensions: 1) contextual 
  indicators; 2) indicators related to the program; 3) impact indicators (<a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a>). The first dimension is established by the context in which the AIDS 
  epidemic occurs in the country, represented by demographic characteristics and 
  socioeconomic characteristics of the population, as well as the national health 
  system indicators. The second is divided into 14 sub-areas related to the PN-STD/AIDS, 
  which include individual vulnerabilities, prevention strategies, care given, 
  AIDS vigilance, and STD prevention and control. The third dimension allows for 
  the analysis of impact of the developed actions in terms of morbidity-mortality 
  due to AIDS and other STDs.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The indicators classified as monitoring can also be
categorized in accordance with the proposed institutions, such as
the World Bank and UNGASS, institutions with whom the National
Program signed an agreement to monitor indicators.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From an evaluation 
  point of view, the indicators are classified according to the PNA.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  Within this logic, the indicators are first classified along evaluation guidelines, 
  which include: external context, organizational context; implementation; performance; 
  and impact. In this classification, the indicators are grouped into clusters 
  of implementation (access and quality) and performance (effectiveness and user 
  satisfaction). In the analysis, they are still classified according to technical 
  components of the Program that includes epidemiological vigiliance, prevention, 
  and care. In addition to these, the innovative component should also be included 
  and reserved to adjust for unexpected operational program realities.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INDICATORS PROPOSED 
  BY UNGASS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A group of indicators 
  was developed in 2002 with the goal of establishing the progress of the implementation 
  of the UNGASS Declaration of Commitment. Initially, they were grouped into three 
  categories: 1) national commitment and action, focused on political, strategic, 
  and financial inputs for the prevention of HIV infection; 2) national behavior 
  and knowledge, with indicators related to the program products, results and 
  reach; 3) national impact, with the goal of expressing the success of each program 
  in reducing HIV infection rates.<sup>11</sup> <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29433t2.gif">Table 
  2</a> shows a list of indicators which are central to UNGASS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of these 13 indicators initially proposed by UNGASS, five are
not included in MONITORAIDS:</font></p>

        control of STD and AIDS.</font></p>

      this indicator, the businesses that develop a group of activities including 
      the distribution of antiretroviral medications and provision of anonymous 
      HIV/AIDS testing in the workplace are included. In Brazil, monitoring of 
      this is not relevant as antiretroviral medications are provided through 
      the public health system. In addition, it is not a government policy to 
      stimulate testing at the workplace.</font></td>

        of patients with STDs at health clinics appropriately diagnosed, treated, 
        and counseled" - This is because care provided to STD patients is decentralized 
        and occurs, primarily, in the basic health care clinics. Additionally, 
        technical and operational difficulties exist in the construction of this 
        indicator, in terms of estimating the total number of patients with STDs 
        and the number of patients with STDs that were appropriately diagnosed, 
        treated, and counseled.</font></p>

        that the epidemic in Brazil is concentrated, and presents an estimated 
        prevalence rate of 0.41%<sup>10</sup> among women in reproductive age 
        and 5.8 deaths due to AIDS for every 100 thousand women between 15 and 
        49. To construct this indicator, a population-based household survey would 
        be necessary with a large sample size, which would implicate excessive 
        costs for little utility to monitor the Brazilian epidemic.</font></p>

        of people with advanced HIV infection receiving antiretroviral combination 
        therapy" - This is a relevant indicator. Nonetheless, it was not included 
        because in accordance with UNGASS guidelines, 15% of the people infected 
        with HIV are in advanced stages of infection. Remembering that 600,000 
        people are infected with HIV in Brazil<sup>10</sup> and of these, 166,500 
        receive antiretroviral therapy (ARV), the percent of people in Brazil 
        would be over 100%. Still, it is important to emphasize the percentage 
        of patients that need to receive treatment in Brazil, but are not in ARV 
        therapy, such as those who do not have symptoms and were never tested 
        for HIV infection.</font></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some indicators 
  proposed by UNGASS are relevant for the monitoring of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil, 
  but are not contemplated in MONITORAIDS due to the lack of data available to 
  calculate the indicator. One example is "the percentage of injecting drug users 
  who adopted behaviors to reduce the risk of HIV transmission." The unavailability 
  of this data is a result of the difficulty of conducting studies in populations 
  that are difficult to access, such as injecting drug users (IDU). As an indicator 
  of a change in risk behavior, the indicator, "percent of IDUs that do not share 
  needles," is available, although the data comes from a specific study and does 
  not represent all of Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The indicator, "Percentage of young people aged 15-24 that
HIV-infected," was substituted in MONITORAIDS for two similar
ones, "Percentage of individuals between 15-49 infected with
HIV," and "Percentage of young men between 17-21 infected with
HIV." These two were constructed from studies with representative
samples of the country. To construct the indicator proposed by
UNGASS, it would necessary to significantly increase the sample
used in the studies of sero-prevalence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most recent 
  estimates of the six common indicators and both monitoring systems are presented 
  in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29433t3.gif">Table 3</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The indicators 
  proposed by UNGASS in 2002 were more relevant to generalized epidemics and of 
  restricted utility for counties with concentrated epidemics. To address this 
  problem, in July 2005, a new version of the indicators was made available, which 
  resulted in a revision of the list of indicators previously proposed.<sup>12</sup> 
  In this new version, two distinct groups of indicators were proposed in accordance 
  with the nature of the epidemic in the country: concentrated or generalized. 
  In the case of Brazil, which is characterized by a concentrated epidemic, the 
  indicators aim to accompany high-risk populations. The high-risk populations 
  are determined by each country, taking the characteristics of their epidemic 
  into consideration. These indicators are listed in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29433t4.gif">Table 
  4</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Program recognizes that these new indicators are
relevant to monitor the epidemic in the country. However, their
construction depends on the realization of a several studies with
the important vulnerable populations in the Brazilian
epidemic.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The initiative to construct a supranational monitoring system
based on standardized indicators allows the comparison of
performance of various national HIV/AIDS control
programs.<sup>12</sup> It also identifies regions where greater
efforts and investments are needed to control the epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, international comparisons have, at times, important
limitations. First, due to the fact that countries are in
different stages of the epidemic. In addition, there are enormous
variations between nations, determined by distinct political,
economic, social, and cultural contexts as well as organizational
aspects of national health systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another question is whether the indicators proposed by UNGASS,
taken by themselves, have sufficient reach to be management tools
and assist in decision making. This is due to the fact that these
indicators do not attend to all the specificities and priorities
of each country.<sup>4</sup> Taking Brazil as an example, the
reach of testing for HIV during pregnancy is an indicator that
has been shown to be extremely relevant in monitoring prevention
activities.<sup>8</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An important restriction found in the first version of the
UNGASS indicators was the group of indicators proposed which were
of little importance for countries with concentrated epidemics,
or with difficulties to calculate. For example, to calculate the
prevalence rate of HIV among young people between 15-24 very
expensive studies with extremely large sample sizes are
necessary, limitations recognized by the group that coordinated
UNGASS monitoring. In July 2005, the new version of indicators
that differentiated between forms of the epidemic was
disseminated (concentrated or generalized).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This new version totally moved the focus of the monitoring
proposed in countries with concentrated epidemics. If one hand,
the indicators are more relevant for vulnerable subgroups, on the
other hand, those relevant to the general population are
neglected, which may generate an interruption in a historic
process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, in case of countries with concentrated epidemics,
there is always the possibility that an epidemic may become
generalized, and as such, there is a need to monitor indicators
relevant to the general population. In the case of Brazil,
epidemiological data indicate that socioeconomic class has
progressively become a vulnerability factor,<sup>2,9</sup> noting
an occurrence of high risk behaviors among the poor and in
regions with lower social development.<sup>5</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regardless of the limitations pointed out in the present
study, the change of the focus of UNGASS broadens the options of
possible indicators, which is important for monitoring the
dynamic of the spread of the epidemic in Brazil. In the case of
countries with concentrated epidemics like Brazil, the current
focus is on vulnerable populations, which facilitates
participation in international scientific debates regarding
methodologies to study these population groups. The importance of
estimating the size of vulnerable population groups and obtaining
information regarding their attitudes, behaviors, and practices
should be recognized. However, difficulties exist in producing
reliable estimates of these groups in population based studies.
To respond to this situation, Brazil is currently focusing its
efforts on developing, adapting, and sharing alternative sampling
methodologies for hard to reach populations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, the proposed supranational indicators to
monitor the epidemic permit international comparisons of
advancements achieved and stimulate countries to discuss and make
their (indicators) construction viable. In a complementary way,
the national monitoring systems should focus on program
improvement by covering areas that permit the evaluation of
specific control and intervention actions. Independent of efforts
to design monitoring systems which are adequate reflections of
each country, the limitations imposed by the lack of data and/or
the high costs involved in obtaining it, especially in developing
countries, continues to be a challenge.</font></p>
