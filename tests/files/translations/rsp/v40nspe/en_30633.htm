<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This essay focuses on the pioneer activities of public health
dentistry in Brazil and its evolution in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century with emphasis on the emergency of a landmark, the
<i>sanitary dentistry</i>. Social and preventive dentistry and
market dentistry, with reference to the main theoretical works
representative of these trends, are presented. The essential
characteristics of <i>collective oral health</i> (Brazilian
variant of public health dentistry) and <i>buccality</i> are
presented. The relationship between collective oral health and
collective health as well as the implications of the buccality
concept for the development of public health dentistry actions
and new guidance of clinical practice in public services of the
Brazilian Health System (SUS) are discussed. The key elements of
an agenda for collective oral health based on proposals presented
at the 3<sup>rd</sup> National Conference on Oral Health are
addressed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The publication of "Manual de odontologia sanit&aacute;ria"
(The manual of sanitary dentistry)<sup>5</sup> in 1960 by
M&aacute;rio Chaves has deeply marked the theory and practice of
public health interventions in dentistry in Brazil, influenced
several generations and extended its outreach to the whole Latin
America. The publication of a Spanish version of this work by the
Pan American Health Organization<sup>6</sup> two years later was
its definite recognition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vasconcellos<sup>22</sup> points out that Law 1,280 of
12/19/1911 established the first three positions of dentists in
public services in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo, Southern
Brazil. So public dental care services began to be provided to
the State Police Force and to those people in custody of state
authorities under the State Justice and Security Department. In
1929, dental providers were incorporated to the staff of the
State Interior Department School Health Supervision, at that time
in charge of education and health activities statewide. In 1932,
after S&atilde;o Paulo State Education and Health Department was
created, the Hygiene and Dental Care Inspector's Department was
established in the health care service "to provide care to state
public schoolchildren". Vasconcellos underlines that, when
S&atilde;o Paulo State Health Department was created in 1947, the
recommendation was that all health centers should have
"oral-dental care services" available. Since then the
organization of public dental care has been marked by successive
institutional arrangements both at the state of S&atilde;o Paulo
and national level.<sup>21</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While education actions were developed<sup>21,22</sup> these
providers' clinical practice basically replicated that of
dentists in their private practices. Patients were approached on
an individual basis and no population-based diagnoses were made,
and nor even was applied any programming technology derived from
planning processes that included oral health of the population as
a whole.<sup>14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This scenario changed dramatically when, in 1952, there were
implemented by the <i>Servi&ccedil;o Especial de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i> (SESP - Special Public Health Service) the
first sanitary dentistry programs, first in the city of
Aimor&eacute;s, state of Minas Gerais, then in several
municipalities of the Northern, Northeastern, and Southern
regions of Brazil.<sup>14</sup> These programs mainly targeted
schoolchildren since they were regarded as epidemiologically more
vulnerable and, at the same time, most sensitive to public health
interventions. Methods and techniques of health planning and
programming were incorporated to the daily practice of dozens of
dental providers in many regions of Brazil.<sup>13,14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Narvai<sup>14</sup> emphasizes that, in the context of the
Second World War, the "restricted" access to private dental
practices to most Brazilians has resulted in a small but
significant rupture of dental care services production due to the
establishment of a state-run modality for these services. Market
dentistry remained absolutely predominant but it was no longer
the sole care modality in dental health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new <i>state-run modality of dental services production</i> was based on sanitary dentistry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study focuses on the pioneer activities of public
health dentistry in Brazil and their evolution in the
20<sup>th</sup> century with emphasis to the emergency of a
landmark, sanitary dentistry.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>SANITARY DENTISTRY</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chaves<sup>5</sup> describes sanitary dentistry as "a
discipline of public health that addresses the diagnosis and
treatment of oral health conditions (...) in the community,"
specifically "a city or part of it, a region, country or group of
countries (...). At any level the weight is on the vision of the
whole of the community, the more complex the greater its
geographical area and population (...). The notion that sanitary
dentistry is <i>prevention</i> or it is <i>care to the poor,
pregnant women, schoolchildren or any other group</i>
(italicized in the original) is not substantiated. Sanitary
dentistry is an effort undertaken by the community, in the
community and for the community to achieve the best average oral
health conditions."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SESP experience in Aimor&eacute;s and other municipalities was
the subject of study and consideration of public health experts
with good theoretical background and has originated several
articles, especially Freire's<sup>10</sup> (1964), and Chaves'
book<sup>5</sup>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Manual de odontologia sanit&aacute;roa" was developed
based on public dental health providers' practice in Brazil
during the 1950s of the 20th century. Another important landmark,
part of the process of thinking and streamlining such
experiences, was the Public Health Specialization Program for
Dentists, developed at the <i>Faculdade de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica da Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i>
(FSP-USP).<sup>8</sup> Narvai<sup>14</sup> underlines the role of
M&aacute;rio Chaves and Alfredo Reis Viegas in developing this
program and highlights that "to these pioneers of public health
dentistry in Brazil can be credited the theoretical essentials
guiding the training of hundreds of public health dentists in
Brazil and other countries in Latin America."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main theoretical tool of sanitary dentistry used for
<i>diagnosing and treating the community's oral health
conditions</i> was the so-called <i>incremental system</i>.
Pinto<sup>20</sup> conceives it as a "method of work aiming at
providing comprehensive dental care for a given population
eliminating their cumulative needs and subsequent monitoring
according to priority criteria based on age and conditions," and
underlines the planning of "an horizontal action through
preventive programs to monitor the incidence of conditions, and a
vertical action through treatment programs to solve prevalent
conditions. In parallel, those actions are supported by an
education program". He points out that, although usually applied
in schoolchildren for operational reasons, "its general
methodology, after some adjustments, can be easily applied to
other groups".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assessing the application of this technology in Brazil,
Diniz<sup>8</sup> ponders "it was practically a cure-all to
public health authorities and dental services managers at the
central level of both health agencies and human resources
training organizations," pointing out that one of SESP's
technical regulations "recommended to focus more on (...)
schoolchildren as this would allow, due to their concentration in
schools, a systematic effort and dynamic action (...) providing
treatment at the very education setting."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given these characteristics 
  and recommendations, the tool was mixed up with sanitary dentistry itself and 
  the idea &#150; highly praised by Chaves &#150; of "an effort developed by the 
  community, in the community and for the community" was lost. Sanitary dentistry 
  has then become limited to dental programs to schoolchildren. Narvai<sup>14</sup> 
  thinks the incremental system lost its effectiveness as "it became a prescription, 
  a model to be replicated acritically," and in contexts of "managerial inadequacy, 
  paucity of resources and lack of epidemiological approach to the programs".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanitary dentistry had the historical task to build on a
dental practice that would break with market dentistry but it
failed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>MARKET DENTISTRY</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Market dentistry</i><sup>14</sup> has always prevailed in
the Brazilian health system. In general, its practice conceived
to be focus on dental care to ailing people, and provided
exclusively by an individual provider in a restricted
clinical-surgical setting not only prevails in the private
sector, but continues to have a powerful impact on public
services. <i>Market dentistry</i> lies on biological and
individual core elements from which its clinical practice are
built up, and on its organicity to the capitalist mode of
production, making health care into goods, mining health as a
common asset with no exchange value, and imposing widely known
mercantile and ethics deformations.<sup>15</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, most public
dental services replicate mechanically and acritically core
elements of the private's sector dental practice model.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>SOCIAL AND PREVENTIVE 
  DENTISTRY</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the theoretical concepts of sanitary dentistry have
been associated to an authoritarian period; they reached their
apogee in the Brazilian military dictatorship darkest years
(1968-1978)<sup>14</sup> but subsequently declined in the
1980.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second half of the last century witnessed the rise of
several <i>forms of dentistry</i> in Brazil. In university
settings, the term <i>social and preventive dentistry</i> was
widely recognized as locus of this profusion of propositions. In
"Odontologia e sa&uacute;de bucal coletiva" (Dentistry and
collective oral health), Narvai<sup>14</sup> describes the
following different forms of dentistry: sanitary, preventive,
social, simplified, comprehensive, community and also collective
oral health. He examines them vis-&agrave;-vis in the contexts
they arose from and explores their connections with more general
proposals to the health sector and different society designs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1989, Pinto<sup>20</sup> published his book, "Sa&uacute;de
bucal: odontologia social e preventiva" (Oral health: social and
preventive dentistry), which became a reference work in the
field. This author organized, systematized and updated the
theoretical foundations on which should lie the planning and
programming of public health dentistry actions. Together with the
second edition of M&aacute;rio Chaves' book,<sup>7</sup> an
expanded and revised publication released in 1977 with the new
title "Odontologia social" (Social dentistry), Pinto's book
constituted a significant contribution to both service planning
and human resources training.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the end of the last century, the
<i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Odontologia
Preventiva</i> (ABOPREV - Brazilian Association of Preventive
Dentistry) published "Promo&ccedil;&atilde;o de sa&uacute;de
bucal" (Oral health promotion), a collection of works from dozens
of Brazilian and foreign authors coordinated by
Kriger,<sup>11</sup> that further described the technical and
scientific foundations on which planning and management of dental
services could be built on. More recently, further significant
efforts have been undertaken with the publication of "Odontologia
em sa&uacute;de coletiva" (Dentistry in collective
health)<i>,</i> by Pereira<sup>18</sup> (2003), and "Sa&uacute;de
bucal coletiva: metodologia de trabalho e pr&aacute;ticas"
(Collective oral health: work methodology and practices), by
Angelim<sup>1</sup> (2006).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the publication of "Epidemiologia e
bioestat&iacute;stica na pesquisa odontol&oacute;gica"
(Epidemiology and biostatistics in dentistry research), by Luiz
et al<sup>12</sup> (2005), and "Epidemiologia da sa&uacute;de
bucal" (Epidemiology of oral health), by Antunes &amp;
Peres<sup>2</sup> (2006), the field, cleared by sanitary
dentistry, continued to stress its calling for
contemporaneousness and for highly knowledgeable and expert
exchange of ideas with the best international scientific
production on account of the quality and high theoretical content
of these works.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000 the fourth edition of Pinto's<sup>19</sup> book was
published under a new title, "Sa&uacute;de bucal coletiva"
(Collective oral health).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  that, Narvai<sup>15</sup> (2001) points out to the increased use of the term 
  <i>collective oral health</i> in technical and scientific publications, arguing 
  that <i>collective</i> was added to the term <i>oral health</i> in 1980 in Brazil. 
  According to him, <i>collective oral health</i> has become widely known, especially 
  in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo by clear influence of the collective health 
  movement, and that besides showing in many articles and books, a national association 
  (<i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Sa&uacute;de Bucal Coletiva</i> &#150; 
  Abrasbuco &#150; Brazilian Association of Collective Oral Health) was created 
  in 1998 having the term collective oral health as part of its official denomination.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>COLLECTIVE ORAL 
  HEALTH</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Narvai &amp; Fraz&atilde;o,<sup>17</sup>
"collective oral health is a field of knowledge and practices
that are part of a broader whole known as <i>collective
health</i> and, that at the same time, also comprises the
<i>dentistry</i> field, incorporating it and redefining it and
thus necessarily transcending it". For them, collective oral
health (COH) advocates that people's oral health "is a result not
only of dental practice but also of social constructions
consciously created by people in any concrete situation,
including health providers and also (or even) dentists. As a
social process, each situation is unique, singular, historical,
and does not allow to being mechanically replicated or reproduced
in any other concrete situation since the elements and dimensions
of each process are contradictory, conflicting and characterized
by individual negotiations and agreements". This concept implies
(and, in a sense, imposes) an epistemological rupture of COH with
(market) <i>dentistry</i> since its theoretical framework is set
on biological and individual foundations (on which its practice
is based) and its practice disregards the effect of complex
social processes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fraz&atilde;o<sup>9</sup> argues that COH intends to "replace
all types of <i>technicism</i> and de <i>biologism</i> existing
in specific formulations in social and preventive dentistry,
(....) by carrying out a theoretical reconstruction of collective
health thinking and action in an articulate and organic manner
and reinforcing the historical compromise of collective health
with society's quality of life and people's rights protection
against both the predatory action of capital and the
authoritarian action of the State."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This replacement of "all types of technicism and biologism"
has gained significant theoretical contribution from the proposal
of <i>buccality</i>" formulated by Botazzo<sup>3</sup> (2000) in
"Da arte dent&aacute;ria" (<i>Of dental art)</i>, Botazzo states
that buccality consists of a theoretical-methodological approach
where "oral mechanisms," identified as mastication, language and
eroticism, are key, and are defined as "world's consumption" to
naturally survive (mastication), "word production and
consumption" (language), and love relationship and production of
"sexual oral acts" (erotica), respectively.<sup>3,4</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Botazzo<sup>4</sup> emphasizes that health does not exhaust
itself in the clinical form and that dentistry theory does not
manage to recover human beings as a whole, opening up infinite
possibilities to produce knowledge and practices from the
reference of buccality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this sense, Narvai<sup>16</sup> points out that the
epistemological rupture with (market) dentistry COH intends to
carry out entails developing a <i>praxis</i> that should
dialectically break with the prevailing dental practice. Such
rupture requires the development of dentistry efforts based on
(<i>all</i>) people's needs and that, in opposition to the market
logic, be able to break with the <i>status quo</i> basically
characterized by the merchantability of services and maintenance
of the monopoly of access to (<i>all</i>) dental resources by
elites. This author believes COH has inherently a double intent:
on one hand, it intends <i>to render</i> oral health <i>less
dental</i>; on the other hand, it intends to assure to all access
to all required resources effectively establishing dental care as
a human right.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>AN AGENDA FOR 
  COLLECTIVE ORAL HEALTH</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to promote 
  changes, COH needs to develop an agenda taking into consideration the relevant 
  events in the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico 
  de Sa&uacute;de</i> (SUS &#150; Brazilian Health System) implementation is at 
  a stage indicating the possibility of carrying out actions that would allow 
  to meet the needs of all people (principle of universality), making it possible 
  their access to all dental and general health resources they need (principle 
  of comprehensiveness), and offering more to those in most need (principle of 
  equity).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUS is recognizably an important social achievement of
Brazilian people that proved to be able to survive the neoliberal
avalanche that, in the last decades, has destroyed most public
health systems in Latin America. Recognizing that does not mean
to overlook the serious difficulties the health sector has had to
face due to either poor life conditions of most population (which
have great impact on health) or budget and management problems
characteristic of public administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUS framework, an enduring social fabric involving hundreds of
agencies, institutions, trade union organizations, patient
advocacy groups among others, has being able to prevail over the
fragmented and centralized public health structure that
predominated in Brazil in the last century.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An accomplishment of this process is the establishment of
periodical health meetings held in the three levels of
government, among which are oral health meetings. These meetings
should be the main reference for the <i>collective oral
health</i> agenda.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Final Report 
  of the Third National Meeting on Oral health (CNSB) (Bras&iacute;lia, 2004)<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  illustrates how this agenda should be drawn up. This document describes a process 
  that directly involved around 90,000 people nationwide and stresses that "oral 
  health and teeth conditions are definitely one of the most significant signs 
  of social exclusion. Fully addressing these problems requires more than aid 
  actions developed by experts. It requires intersectorial policies, integrating 
  preventive and treatment actions with rehabilitation, health promotion, universal 
  access, public responsibility at all society's levels and, more importantly, 
  government compromise and institutional involvement at all three levels of government".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Third CNSB Final Report includes 298 proposals adopted by
883 representatives elected in 27 state meetings which, in turn,
involved representatives nominated in 2,542 regional or local
meetings on oral health. This document is based on four focal
points, namely: 1) education and empowerment; 2) social
leadership, participatory management and oral health; 3) oral
health training and work; and, 4) financing and organization of
oral health care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In regard to <i>education and empowerment</i>, it was
highlighted the importance of promoting equity in health care,
reducing regional inequalities, scaling up health actions
available to assure universal access to most vulnerable
populations as a result of social, gender, race, ethnicity and
generation inequalities, and to migratory populations. It is thus
expected that the right to health and oral health will no longer
be only part of a declaration but becomes part of Brazilian
people's daily lives giving them universal access to medium and
high complexity dental services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To put <i>social leadership and participatory management</i>
into effect, there is a need of creating mechanisms to increase
involvement of managers, providers and users in every SUS unit,
to create sympathetic environments and new possibilities of
associations in these units as well as establishing a voting
process for public health services managers to be elected by
health providers and users, monitored by local health councils,
thus implementing collegiate management in these bodies and
setting up protection mechanisms against interference of partisan
policies into technical health issues.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for <i>oral health training and work</i>, it is thought
that higher education has been ineffective in educating providers
who are compromised with SUS and social leadership. Health
providers training has not been guided by critical understanding
of social needs in oral health. Also, training has been provided
without any discussions by managing bodies and SUS social
involvement. As a consequence, the Ministry of Education, public
and private universities, training institutions for middle level
health providers and groups of decision making experts have been
autonomously ruling on issues such as the number of health
providers to be trained and technical and political contents to
be provided to them. Hence "there are real obstacles for SUS to
apply the constitutional principle to direct human resources to
the health system and providers are still not properly qualified
for SUS effective implementation and development, hindering
comprehensive care and resulting in low quality services". It is
stressed that "in the last 10 years poor working relations have
been established, circumventing the social value of public
employees as a democratic state agent for people's social
protection and the rights conferred on providers by the 1988
Brazilian Constitution". It is also recommended, among other, "to
implement a humanization policy for working conditions and users'
care involving oral health providers, users and managers, and
promoting empowerment and respecting regional particularities,
cultural diversity, and working relations". In addition, "to
create a role performance evaluation system that would be
included in position descriptions, and career and wage plans with
clear mechanisms of career advancement by value, dedication, and
competence supervised by local health councils and employees'
representative commission annually elected".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On <i>financing and organization of oral health care</i>,
reference is made to the embarrassments caused by the way
Brazil's inclusion in the new world economy came about, in
particular the country's indebtedness and massive subordination
to foreign money. The representatives agreed that "access to
basic care should be scaled up and qualified," ensuring dental
care services in all basic health units, including those located
in hardly accessible rural areas and borders, and providing care
during opening hours that would allow access of adults and
working population to this care, including the implementation of
dental prosthesis laboratories in public care settings at
regional and local levels. It is also underlined the importance
of "implementing oral health actions to indigenous and slave
descendant populations after extensive discussions with their
organizations to ensure non-mutilating, universal, comprehensive
and equitable care programs that would take into account cultural
experiences and values concerning hygiene and diet practices in
each one of these people".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These indications constitute a key reference to both
production of knowledge and planning and organization of public
oral health interventions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a need for all those involved with production of
knowledge and health managers not only be familiar with this set
of proposals but also take it into consideration while developing
a <i>collective oral health</i> agenda consistent with the needs
of those who wishes were democratically expressed in the Third
National Meeting on Oral Health.</font></p>
