<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present article focuses on the subject of leadership in
the United Nations Declaration of Commitment in HIV/AIDS,
discussing the advancements, challenges, and limitations to the
action of major social forces acting to control the HIV/AIDS
epidemic in Brazil. The national policy on AIDS was characterized
by the illustrative Brazilian experience in summoning multiple
government,&nbsp;civil society, and private
sector&nbsp;initiatives to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&nbsp;The
synergy between different partners needs to be enhanced and
efforts in the field of&nbsp;scientific and technological
development must be articulated in order to minimize the effects
of technological dependence. These actions are aimed at the
sustainable production of&nbsp;drugs and other products, with the
perspective of improving the fulfillment of the constitutional
precept&nbsp;of health as a universal right.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present text proposes a reflection on a potential link
between the unfolding of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil and the
establishment and activity of leaderships in the Brazilian
context. These leaderships, be they personal or institutional;
governmental, or emanating from civil society, devise and
organize measures aiming at the control of AIDS/HIV in Brazil.
For this purpose, we shall first present the concept of
leadership set forth in the Declaration of Commitment of the
United Nations General Assembly on AIDS Special Session (UNGASS).
Next, we shall present a "critical dialogue," where the concept
of leadership from the perspective of different authors is
presented. The scenario for this discussion is the body of
knowledge generated by the Brazilian experience in the fight
against AIDS. The "critical dialogue" was organized along two
basic lines. The first of these offers a perspective on issues
involving the achievement of the UNGASS leadership targets
according to the governmental action &#150; in the case of Brazil &#150; of
civil society and the private sector. Major issues and lacunae
deemed relevant by the authors were identified. The second line,
critical-propositional in character, considers the directions and
major challenges to be addressed in order to advance in the
achievement of UNGASS targets, considering not only Brazil, but
other realities and scenarios as well.</font></p>

  AIDS, AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UNGASS Declaration of Commitment begins with a statement
of the commitment of heads of State and Government to combat the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in "all its aspects" and summons leaderships
worldwide to employ their powers in "securing global commitment"
to the control of the epidemic.<sup>15</sup> The declaration is
based on the following precepts:</font></p>

</table>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The targets listed 
  in the Declaration redefine traditional views of the social responsibility of 
  world leadership in face of the impact of the pandemic. The role of leaderships 
  may be viewed in this context as an effort to produce cooperative social measures<sup>1</sup> 
  aimed at reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS. In spite of relevant advances, the 
  control of AIDS worldwide remains an important challenge, which demands the 
  renewal of commitments and the review of personal, collective, and institutional 
  responsibilities. Official numbers, which estimate about 4.9 new infections 
  in 2004, indicate the continuous growth of the epidemic.<sup>14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The targets defined at UNGASS aim to create social conditions
that favor the effective reduction of the social and political
vulnerabilities that promote the expansion of the epidemic, which
is becoming increasingly associated with the social inequities
present in many societies, including Brazil. Ultimately, the
commitment expressed in the Declaration implies the
acknowledgement of the importance of not delaying the political
responsibility of making the right decisions when dealing with
issues with direct impact on the life and dignity of the
approximately 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS
worldwide.<sup>13</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding leadership specifically, the UNGASS Declaration
recommends measures for the elaboration, at the national level,
of strategic plans of action with political support, aimed at
fostering the development of preventive and care-related
measures; securing respect to the human rights of persons living
with AIDS/HIV; stimulating the development of civil society; and
implementing monitoring and evaluation strategies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The targets defined by UNGASS include the acknowledgement of
the fundamental role of leadership as a mobilizing agent in the
battle against AIDS, given their role as levers for achieving the
effects desired. These effects imply the participation of some
sort of power,<sup>2</sup> be it from governments or
non-governmental organizations (ONG), from the private sector,
form workers unions, religious institutions, and community
groups, or also from the media, the academic community, and other
social forces, both at the regional and international levels. The
UNGASS Declaration strategically summons the entire capacity
accumulated by nations in order to decelerate the increase in the
number of new infections and to ensure efficient access to
currently available technological resources, especially to
populations living in situations of poverty, risk, and
marginalization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concept of leadership expressed in the document is
apparently novel. Considering the need for mobilization generated
by HIV, it will not be enough to rethink leadership only from the
traditional perspective, based on the authority held by certain
individuals in which power is invested, or on the classical
appeal to the charisma of leaders. Instead, it is based on the
systematic promotion of possibilities to strengthen organization
and articulation capacity and on the creation of new
relationships between social actors. Thus seen, leaderships
should engage in the construction of a new ethics in the use of
power, giving new meaning to individual and collective dimensions
in the commitment to control the epidemic. The Declaration
highlights the need for grounding the practice of leadership on
new values. Structural elements in the materialization of this
new conception include the acquired knowledge and abilities and
the legitimation of the other party in the division of social
responsibilities. Built upon values such as solidarity,
tolerance, and visibility of excluded and socially invisible
social subjects, its practice influences social transformation
and the more clearly conscious involvement of different social
actors as catalysts in the battle against the pandemic. The
Declaration may be said to expresses a relationship between the
concepts of power and right,<sup>2</sup> the building of which,
in many contemporary societies, is still an ongoing process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From different standpoints, authors such as
Pollack<sup>11</sup> already argued, at the very beginning of the
epidemic, that AIDS was imposing on societies a "socialization of
seropositivity." This lead to what the author termed "associative
mobilization," assuming AIDS as a disease that imposes extreme
experiences. Some of the early leaders of the social movement
connected to AIDS emerged from the personal experience of the
disease, which granted specificity on the fight against AIDS in
Brazil as well as in other countries. There was an important
connection between social movements and the construction of
leadership, which will be further discussed below, in the context
of the Brazilian response to AIDS. It is in the scope of UNGASS
that AIDS is reaffirmed as an issue of Public Health, conceived
of as a commitment with human wellbeing as a social and political
realm of contemporary societies. Dazon &amp; Fassin<sup>3</sup>
consider public health as "a state of mind," to which AIDS has
brought a body of new meanings and actors. We highlight the
process of construction of leaderships that attributed new
meanings to the understanding of relationships between health,
disease, and society, precious examples of which are provided by
the NGO social movement in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If, on one hand, there is a propositional dimension to the
definition of leadership adopted in the UNGASS document, on the
other hand, the document abounds in normative language,
characterized by expressions such as "intensifying responses,"
"enhancing coordination," and "increasing ongoing actions." When
evaluating the document, we find little reference to the
possibility of changing the course of action. The document also
contains references to the "acceleration of the implementation of
measures," and the verb "to strengthen" is employed on countless
occasions. Beyond the subject of leadership, there is a profusion
of terms such as "to complement," "to supplement," "to decisively
support," "to increase," among others. Or also, when discussing
scenarios aggravated by the impact of AIDS, verbs appear such as
"to attenuate," "to reduce," and "to cease," always referring to
a mechanism that is already ongoing, and which seems to require
only simple modifications in the intensity of its action.
Therefore, there seems to be little room for a leadership that
disagrees with, or wishes to change the course of, what is
traditionally being done in terms of prevention and treatment of
AIDS. The room left for innovation is thus compromised by the
general language of the document. However, this does not
eliminate the possibility of a propositional role &#150; which is what
is expected from leaderships, be they personal or institutional &#150;
a desire expressed by the UNGASS document.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Focusing on social mobilization, the commitments and actions
in the fight against AIDS must constantly be concatenated and
reconsidered in order for new agreements to enhance synergy in
fighting the epidemic. Other international documents, such as the
Regional HIV/AIDS plan, which is to be fulfilled by
Latin-American and Caribbean countries, are important to
reinforce the political dimension of the State.<sup>9</sup> The
inter-sector dialogue is an essential requisite for the action of
the State towards the establishment of alliances, which are vital
tools for meeting the principles of universality and equity that
should govern interventions in the field of health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a whole, the Brazilian responsibility towards the
commitments made at UNGASS cannot be understood unless two major
actors, essential to the fight against the epidemic, are
considered concomitantly: government and organized civil society.
These two forces have different processes of construction of
leadership and different modes of action. There is also an
important transit of leaderships, not only from NGOs to
government, but also in the opposite direction, which shall be
discussed below. It is well-known that one of the major
characteristics that support the Brazilian response to AIDS is
the articulation between government and large social sectors in
the management of initiatives aimed at reducing the incidence of
infection and dealing with the major problems faced by the
affected population. From the very beginning of the epidemic, as
indicated by the documentation registered in different
studies,<sup>4,8,10</sup> the articulation between these two
actors was essential aimed at shaping the Brazilian response to
the epidemic. Paradoxically, this peculiar trait of the Brazilian
response to AIDS, which we consider as illustrative to other
contexts, poses to Brazil an increased challenge in terms of
improving this partnership and discerning novel courses of action
in the battle against the epidemic. If some countries still need
to be convinced of the importance of such articulation, in Brazil
it will be strategic to devise other possibilities of development
for an already fully consolidated relationship, which needs to
demarcate new territory and engage in the fulfillment of ever
more complex agendas.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>MONITORING OF 
  LEADERSHIP-RELATED COMMITMENTS IN THE CASE OF BRAZIL</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the governmental 
  perspective, the initiative of monitoring the advancement of UNGASS targets 
  and of strengthening managerial and technical capabilities that favor their 
  achievement must be acknowledged. The monitoring of activities provides evidence 
  of the action of leaderships. Regarding the National Program for STD/AIDS (<i>Programa 
  Nacional de DST e AIDS</i> - PN-DST/AIDS), for instance, there have been important 
  advances in the quality of antenatal and maternity care, with an increase in 
  the coverage of women diagnosed as HIV-positive, especially among expectant 
  mothers, and reduction in mother-to-child transmission rates. Another important 
  factor is the articulation between several areas of the Ministry of Health &#150; 
  Woman's Health, Family Health, Child Health and Nutrition &#150; to establish 
  directives for reducing mother-to-child transmission. All these actions are 
  marked by the pressure and activity of leaderships from the feminist movement 
  and women's organizations. These range from leaderships restricted to neighborhoods 
  or specific regions to instances of nationwide articulation, such as feminist 
  councils and NGOs with deep penetration into the media and strong influence 
  over the executive and legislative branches of power. This is complemented by 
  the possibility of using the quick test for diagnosing HIV in populations exposed 
  to greater risk or to whom access is difficult, regulated by a ministerial decree, 
  as a strategy for increasing access to diagnosis.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  This achievement was characterized by the activity of leaderships from the homosexual 
  and sex workers movements and from NGOs providing aid to drug users.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leaderships from civil society, especially NGOs, act mainly
through projects that are usually financed by government or
international funds. The quest for sustainability in NGO
activities, and consequently, for the activity of the leaderships
within these organizations, has led to the creation of novel
logistics for the transfer of financial resources. Worthy of note
in this scenario is the decentralized character of resource
transfer which increases the possibility of synergy between
government and different civil society groups, whose major
achievements are analyzed below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Civil society's initiative to become involved in the
monitoring of UNGASS targets represents a more elaborate level of
activity funding, and is a reference point for understanding the
innovative role of Brazilian activists. The involvement of civil
society grants greater power to the mobilization policy and
social participation that are characteristic of NGOs in the
exercise of the social control predicted by the Unified
Healthcare System (<i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> &#150;
SUS). Brazilian NGOs also spoke up, and became part of the
official Brazilian delegation at the UNGASS meeting.<sup>7</sup>
What was seen was that the leaderships of Brazilian NGOs were not
restricted to the role of executors or critics of the Brazilian
AIDS program, but instead, are going through a process of
appropriation of the concepts of evaluation and monitoring, and
of occupation of niches at this level. This has also allowed
these leaderships to represent Brazil at the United Nations,
especially in decision-making forums, such as the 2001 UNGASS,
illustrating the process of production of Brazilian leaderships
recognized at international level within the context of the AIDS
epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no doubt that the role of NGOs remains fundamental to
work with populations of difficult access and with marginalized
sectors. The repeated struggle for the fulfillment of the
guarantee of universal access to antiretroviral drugs is at the
front of the actions of organized civil society. In 2005, a
number of scenarios marked by the scarcity or lack of medication
have required firm positions from civil society in defense of
rights established in the Brazilian Constitution. Requests have
been diverse in nature, including the holding of public acts of
disapproval, the filing of petitions, and even public proposals
to the Ministry of Health for the breach of the patents of
certain antiretroviral drugs, which consume a substantial portion
of the national budget for HIV/AIDS care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The leadership of NGOs could be felt also within another
important decision-making organ, the National AIDS Committee
(<i>Comis&atilde;o Nacional de AIDS</i>), which works as an
assessor in the elaboration and implementation of the Brazilian
HIV/AIDS policy. This committee incorporates a variety of social
actors, from both government and civil society, closely involved
with the course of the epidemic. It is also a forum for the
resolution of problematic issues, such as the compulsory
licensing of medication, pharmaceutical technological
development, the fight for the human rights of persons living
with HIV/AIDS, the battle against discrimination and
stigmatization, and the acknowledgement of the diversity of
sexual orientation, among other subjects.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the realm of Brazilian civil society, the generation of
leaderships connected to religious institutions is also worthy of
note. In spite of their peculiar view of the epidemic, these
institutions promote actions for the prevention of HIV/AIDS. The
<i>Pastoral da AIDS</i> considers the epidemic as a problem of
society as a whole, and its activities reach beyond the Brazilian
border, including exchanges with other countries. The Lutheran
church promotes mobilization campaigns in media networks,
promoting solidarity, the revival of ethical values, and the need
to respect persons living with HIV/AIDS.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ADVANCES, CHALLENGES, 
  AND PROBLEMS REGARDING THE LEADERSHIP targets</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A common characteristic of the various responses to the UNGASS
Commitment in Brazil, with respect to the leadership phenomenon,
is the presence of concrete facts that show that the Commitment
is being undertaken to an expressive degree by government and
civil society alike. Both sectors are engaging efforts in
maintaining high mobilization, and show synchrony in the
execution of more inclusive social policies and in the planning
of socially relevant strategies of action. However, certain
fragilities and differences in pace reveal the need for a fine
tuning of the capacity of articulation between these two actors
and for the inclusion of new players in the battle against the
epidemic, thus enhancing cooperation and filling the remaining
gaps.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Present results in terms of large-scale policies allow us a
certain degree of optimism. Arduously earned achievements are at
the root of Brazil's worldwide leadership and the effectiveness
in the execution of a national response which articulates
comprehensive actions of prevention, care, treatment, and human
rights, with significant results.<sup>8</sup> The activity of
leaderships from civil society, government, and private
enterprise have turned Brazil into a worldwide leader in the
fight against AIDS. However, results in terms of small-scale
policies vary in a country with geographic, social, economic, and
sanitary conditions of continental breadth. At this level, some
major fragilities, pertaining to the action of leaderships both
from civil society and government, become apparent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current scenario varies greatly in terms of region and of
the working methodology employed within different civil society
organizations. A number of NGOs rest on the certainty of
government-funded projects and do not fully explore the
possibilities of expanding their funding sources through
professional fund-raising activity. Lacking means for
self-sustainability, these organizations remain at risk of
becoming hostages of the funding organs, thus limiting the full
extent of their most genuine capabilities and their scope for
critical reflection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An important issue regarding the Brazilian experience is the
continuous consumption of leaderships from NGOs by the
government, especially by the National Program and by state and
municipal organs, in a process that occurs throughout the
country. While an evaluation encompassing the whole range of
peculiarities of the national scenario is still lacking, an
assessment of the country's major states and municipalities shows
that the migration of leaderships from NGOs to government leaves
a void in civil society, which is often filled by individuals of
lesser theoretical and political caliber and weaker understanding
of the epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The evaluation indicates that the production of leaderships by
NGOs and other civil society instances is perhaps not occurring
at the pace or level necessary to keep up with the enormous
diversification of issues currently brought up by the fight
against AIDS. We find that the social AIDS movement in Brazil
either does not have leaders for a series of areas of activity,
or these leaders are insufficient in number. This is evident in
the issue of drugs and patents, in the cooperation between
countries in the South-South context, and in the presence and
activity in the networks built by civil society across
Latin-America and throughout the world. Brazil is clearly
underrepresented at these levels. We also lack leaderships able
to dialogue with and infiltrate the more general issue of SUS and
public health, which assumes an understanding of its history,
dynamics, and current processes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly to what is seen in NGOs, the government itself rests
on the symbolic capital of being acknowledged as running a
program of excellence, thus postponing incisive responses to
fundamental problems such as the complete fulfillment of drug and
anti-retroviral therapy distribution programs. Decentralization
was an advancement in the consolidation of SUS and an
acknowledgement of civil society organizations as partners in the
fight against AIDS. However, it has also led to new modes of
public administration which are still being constructed and
assimilated, slowly and at different rates, by the state and
municipal levels of government. Delays and the non-fulfillment of
planned activities for the management of the epidemic are still
common in certain states and municipalities. All these issues
indicate a process of bureaucratization and a relative "settling"
of leaderships formed in the governmental sphere, who manage the
epidemic with little attention to the substantial changes
occurred in recent years, such as the appearance of new actors,
the aggravation of old problems, and the emergence of new
scenarios.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are still problems with access to diagnosis. As to
prevention, although government distribution of condoms is
increasing year after year, there are few projects for the social
marketing of condom use, and the cost to the consumer is still
high. Other fragilities are observed in the care and health
promotion for AIDS orphans, estimates of which are not a
consensus. Reaching the population of users of injectable drugs
is also a challenge to the improvement of hazard-reduction
policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Countless forums and seminaries have lead to the conclusion
that the role played by NGOs was much more propositional in
character during the designing of the Brazilian experience at the
beginning of the epidemic, and that now this process is losing in
importance. The technicalization and bureaucratization that is
currently affecting NGOs have helped reduce this possibility. As
an example, we may cite the projects proposed by NGOs in the last
five years in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil.
The proposals included in these projects show strict adherence to
what is prescribed in the application forms or calls for
projects, showing little innovation. Why not propose a program of
prevention for the deaf communities of large cities, or a
household visit campaign for housewives? Or also, why not focus
on a specific population, such as young members of traditional
cultural centers in Southern Brazil or in other regions? NGOs,
organized in forums and other instances, collaborate in the
definition of themes and in the elaboration of calls for projects
published by state AIDS coordinations. However, this process
still seems to be oriented by a strong epidemiological logic,
which relegates issues of political nature, in which NGOs tread,
to a secondary status.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is also little participation of traditional NGOs from
other areas in the calls for projects for AIDS interventions.
Unions of populations of workers defined as epidemiologically
vulnerable according to official documents (such as truck drivers
and miners, among others) also fail to elaborate projects in
response to the calls made by PN-DST/AIDS. Furthermore,
partnership with these unions is rarely sought by NGOs
traditionally dealing with the AIDS problem, as evidenced by the
list of projects approved in recent years, published at the
PN-DST/AIDS website.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A complex issue is that of the construction of the
institutional leadership of an NGO within a specific population.
For example, the leadership constructed by certain NGOs among sex
workers all around the country seems occasionally to be converted
into a process of tutoring for this population. There is a
tendency to situate NGOs halfway between the specific population
and the State apparatus, especially healthcare services and
police instances. NGOs play the intermediate in a series of
problems, "making life easier" life for both healthcare and
police agents and the target population. The institutional
leadership of the NGO thus seems to lean upon an eternal role of
"representing" the population, hindering the construction of
autonomy of popular representation by leaderships emerging from
within the population itself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another relevant issue, related to the already mentioned
subject of Brazil's continental dimensions, are the enormous
problems faced by the country's NGOs due to the disparity between
these organizations. The NGOs from the South and Southeast
Regions often carry out projects in partnership with others from
the Northeast, North, or Center-West Regions. The idea that the
"enlightened" will share their knowledge with the "unenlightened"
is scandalously evident, with severe effects on the idea of
respecting the local production of knowledge. The tendency to
convert constructed experience into a formula for export to other
areas of the world hampers the formation of national leaderships
to act at global level. Furthermore, it impoverishes and reduces
the Brazilian experience in fighting AIDS to a few elements. How
much more enriching wouldn't it be to show an experience
involving urban and rural populations, from the coast, the
jungle, and the inlands, from the outskirts of large cities and
from small and medium-sized cities; experience in working with
the Amerindian, European, and African populations; with different
genders, age groups, religions, professional groups, sexual
orientations, and the entire range of differences with which the
human experience manifests itself. In short, enriching the
Brazilian experience means making it the size of Brazil, and
forming leaderships that share this view.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A positive aspect of the UNGASS document is the presence of
many elements that constitute an essential part of the Brazilian
response to AIDS. Among these, we highlight the respect to human
rights and fundamental liberties; the inseparability of treatment
and prevention; the right to access to medication;
confidentiality; work in partnership with civil society and with
persons living with HIV/AIDS; and the acknowledgement of the role
of leadership as a mobilizing element in favor of the fight
against AIDS. This leads us to the belief that Brazil may
constitute a potential source of leaderships in the field of
AIDS, a leadership constructed upon the relationship with the
abilities accumulated by other countries. The concept of
leadership in the UNGASS document is articulated with the ideas
of commitment and action, and points towards a new ethics in the
exercise of power. This construction of a new ethics is dependent
on the ability of the leadership to produce concepts. Both
leaderships from the social movement and those from the
government sector may be regarded as producers of concepts, which
are tools that are brought to the world, and which also imply
novel ways of looking at things. In Brazil, this is seen in the
concepts of solidarity, life before death, person living with
AIDS, and in the importation and local adaptation of concepts
such as safe sex, among many others. The issue now is whether the
current conceptual production of Brazilian leaderships is in tune
with the political needs of the battle against AIDS. From this
perspective, one may ask the following questions: has Brazil
generated African leaderships that are engaged in the fight
against AIDS? Are there any workers unions involved in it? Are
there leaderships engaged in combating AIDS within the army? Have
leaderships emerged from the homeless and landless movements
which include the AIDS issue in their agendas? Have leaderships
been created among the caretakers of orphaned children? In other
words, has the focus of Brazil's traditional leaderships in the
field of AIDS been broadened to include the whole range of social
forces acting in the country? The production of leaderships that
act in the field of AIDS cannot rely only on persons coming from
the anti-AIDS movements. It needs to be broadened, to include
leaders coming from all social sectors. It is indispensable, for
instance, that public school teachers include leaderships
authorized to deal with the subject of AIDS and which are
recognized within that milieu. The growth of the AIDS epidemic
among the elderly leads to the question of whether leaderships in
the field of AIDS exist among the Brazilian retired.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is a consensus that "a global crisis such as AIDS will
require global solutions,"<sup>12</sup> and that this implies the
formation of leaderships. These leaderships, arising from
concrete and successful experiences from the political and
technical points of view, as is the case with the Brazilian
experience, may be able do devise solutions that are viable in
ever increasing areas of the world, respecting the countless
local peculiarities. However, it is also pertinent to point out
that the world, in spite of its great differences, has also
enormous homogeneities, which cross the different faces assumed
by the pandemic worldwide.</font></p>
