  Celso Furtado, were already emphasizing at the start of the 1960s that true 
  development only takes place when growth is associated with income distribution, 
  endogenous technological development and autonomy in relation to foreign capital 
  and balance-of-payments flows, and even pointed out the need to overcome cultural 
  and consumption patterns that were incompatible with the social inclusion of 
  great masses of the population (Furtado,<sup>10</sup> 1961).<br>

  of the productive capitalist forces and their expansion across the world would 
  tend to disseminate industrial logic to all sectors of activity, including agriculture 
  and services.<br>

  These categories were included in 'equipment', thus serving only as an approximation.<br>

  It was only in 1997 that the conversion from NBM to NCM was fully effected, 
  thereby providing the new basis for classifying foreign trade statistics in 
  Brazil, following the Harmonized System for Designation and Coding of Merchandise, 
  which forms the internationally accepted standard.<br>

  A very preliminary estimate shows that imports have an impact on around 25% 
  of the health budget. (Gadelha CAG. <i>Op</i>. <i>cit</i>.)<br>
