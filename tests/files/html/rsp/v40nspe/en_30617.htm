<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper puts health questions within the context of
national development and industrial policy. It follows the idea
of structuralist, Marxist and Schumpeterian approaches, in which
industry and innovations form determining factors for the

to compete under better conditions with advanced countries have
had an association between strong industry and an endogenous

health, this vision presents problems because business interests
move according to the economic logic of profit rather than to
meet health needs. The notion of the health-industrial complex is
an attempt to provide a theoretical reference that enables
linkage between two distinct types of logic: health and economic
development. This study has sought to show, on the basis of
foreign trade data, how disregard for the logic of health policy
development has led to a situation of economic vulnerability in
this sector, which may limit the objectives of universality,
equality and comprehensiveness. Within this context, a cognitive
and political break with these antagonistic visions that put
health needs on one side and industrial needs on the other is
proposed. A country that aims to reach a condition of development
and independence requires strong innovative industries and an
inclusive and universal health system, at the same time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper puts health questions within the context of
national development and industrial policy. It follows the idea
of structuralist, Marxist and Schumpeterian approaches, in which
industry and innovations form determining factors for the
dynamism in capitalist economies and relative positions within
the world economy. All countries that have developed and started
to compete under better conditions with advanced countries have
had an association between strong industry and an endogenous base
of knowledge, learning and innovation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, in the health field, this vision presents problems
because business interests move according to the economic logic
of profit rather than to meet health needs. The notion of the
health-industrial complex is an attempt to provide a theoretical
reference that enables linkage between two distinct types of
logic: health and economic development. This arises because
health is simultaneously a right within citizenship and a
strategic front for development and innovation within the
knowledge society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of the present study was to show, on the basis
of data on innovation potential in Brazil and foreign trade data,
how disregard for the logic of health policy development has led
to a situation of economic vulnerability in this sector, which
may limit the objectives of universality, equity and
comprehensiveness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DEVELOPMENT 
  AND INDUSTRIAL POLICY: THE STRUCTURALIST TRADITION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question of 
  development and industrial policy always permeates the debate around the role 
  of the State in overcoming the backwardness in underdeveloped countries. In 
  Brazil, this debate guided the contributions of the "classical development economics" 
  to overcoming dependence and underdevelopment . Several authors can be cited, 
  such as: Prebisch,<sup>19</sup> Furtado,<sup>10</sup> Tavares,<sup>22</sup> 
  Cardoso &amp; Faletto<sup>4</sup> and Cardoso de Mello,<sup>5</sup> among many 
  others within the ECLAC tradition (Economic Commission for Latin America and 
  the Caribbean),<a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> who were always against the 
  idea that<a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> natural market forces would lead 
  to a convergence in per capita income and individuals' standard of living. The 
  development strategy and changes would require ruptures in the economic structure 
  and political and institutional order.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is within this theoretical context that developmental
policies were pursued in various Latin American countries over
the period from 1930 to 1980. Industry was taken as the central
core of the strategies of these countries that craved to overcome
their situation of dependence and their location on the periphery
of the economic system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Industrialization 
  would simultaneously allow the production of goods with greater added value, 
  endogenization of the generation of technical progress, and improvement in international 
  position &#150; or in the language of ECLAC, there would be exchange between 
  primary and industrial goods. This would progressively lead to development and 
  a reduction in the dependence on developed countries. In short, the struggle 
  for development was the struggle for industrialization. At a political level, 
  industry would also allow a new alliance between the industrial bourgeoisie 
  and the workers, to the detriment of the "backward" primary exporting segments. 
  Thus, this would enable a more inclusive and egalitarian pattern of development, 
  in conjunction with other policies such as agrarian reform.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Tavares<sup>22</sup> (1979), the
industrialization process was not natural and would involve
qualitative leaps and ruptures in the productive structure. In
its first phase, the process would involve the installation of
"light" industries with lower capital and technological
requirements, so that in a subsequent phase, heavy industries
with inputs of basic raw materials and capital goods would come
in. In this second phase, the role of the State would be seen to
be central, allowing the financing of the capital accumulation
and coordination of the complementary investments, including
investments in economic infrastructure. The instruments utilized
would go from reserving a market for the national and foreign
private segment to setting up large-sized state companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the purposes of the present article, it is not appropriate
to make a more in-depth critique of this vision, but only to
extract some of the more important ideas for the case of Brazil,
from authors who at that time shared the developmental and ECLAC
tradition. In brief, although the national problem was treated in
depth, the questions of the development model, inequality and
exclusion were incorporated according to a simplistic view of the
relationship between the State and society. The internal class
interests associated with international capital were not
considered adequately and perpetuated the dependence and
incorporation of the bottom segments in the social pyramid
(Cardoso &amp; Faletto,<sup>4</sup> 1979). In fact, the
endogenous reality of the development of capitalist forces in
Brazil, within a national development picture that was late in
the historical context of the advanced (or oligopolistic) phase
of world capitalism and the past of slavery and colonialism, was
disregarded. In other words, the question of development was
largely reduced to the relationship between the center and the
periphery, without considering the internal capitalistic,
economic, political and social dynamics of a backward and
dependent country (Cardoso de Mello,<sup>5</sup> 1982).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the point of view of more recent theories, which started
from the studies by Schumpeter<sup>21</sup> on development
centered on the process of innovation, it can be said that the
typical model from ECLAC did not distinguish between production
capacity incorporated in machines and equipment, and
technological capacity. In other words, in more present-day
terms, the knowledge and learning base form the most prominent
dynamic factors in company and national competitiveness. The
systemic nature of innovation, with industry as the dynamic core
of the generation and dissemination of technical progress was
little considered. Consequently, there was little emphasis on the
competencies required for a continuous learning process and for
setting up an endogenous basis for innovation that would allow
the introduction of continual improvements in goods, services and
production processes, thereby also raising the capacity for
prospecting and absorbing technology from the international
frontier. In other words, today it is clearly perceived that for
economic development, it is not enough to have productive
capacity but it is also essential to have a systemic and
industrial base that is capacitated for generating knowledge and
innovation (Kim &amp; Nelson,<sup>16</sup> 2005).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Independent of the criticisms and the fact that, in certain
situations like the Brazilian one, the concrete process of
expansion of peripheral capitalism has been extremely excluding
and unequal, the growth and diversification of the manufacturing
sector and industrial policy have been at the root of overcoming
the dependence and changing the international division of labor.
This is a point of unity among all the authors cited, who have
focused their concerns on the development process, taking the
basis of its role as the motor for technical progress and
dissemination of innovations to the whole system, including to
agriculture and services. The structuralist ECLAC perception
formed a very strong reference that guided the development path
pursued by Brazil between 1950 and 1980. Even as an excluding and
concentrating model, particularly during the years of
authoritarianism, this vision of development was behind a
vigorous process of economic growth (an average of more than 8%
per year), accompanied by strong changes in the production
structure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The neoliberal revolution took place at the end of the 1970s
and during the 1980s, and the ideas from this are still very
present in current public policies. This revolution incisively
attacked the development strategy adopted, a model that was
labeled as "import substitution". In these ideas, the State's
role of induction and coordination was rejected and the policies
adopted were accused of being inefficient and ineffective.
International agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank (IBRD) adopted a view in their norms and
policies that the essential role of the State should be to create
the foundations for a market economy to function well (by
following a "marketing conforming approach"). This was emphasized
in reference documents containing critiques and proposals for a
new model (BIRD,<sup>1,2</sup> 1993, 1997).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The successful experience of East Asian countries was also
(re) read in a distorted and fallacious manner, as successful
cases of development without selective interventionism from the
State in the economic structure, thus going against all the
historical evidence. In this process, the principal targets of
the attack were developmental policies and industrial policy, in
particular (Gadelha,<sup>11</sup> 2001). Along these lines, and
as a counterpart to the successful cases, the Brazilian
experience was presented as an emblematic example of the failure
of the import substitution mode. It was disregarded that the
material basis for a more developed form of capitalism had in
fact been established between the years 1950 and 1980, despite
the problems of inequality, exclusion and precarious basis for
innovations that have already been mentioned. The result from
this attack and the effective exhaustion of the previous model,
in the face of the new challenges brought about by asymmetrical
globalization and the third technological revolution, was more
than two decades of macroeconomic stagnation and involution of
the industrial structure implemented (Coutinho,<sup>8</sup>
2005).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the health field, in the opposite direction to this
restricted view of the State's role, the foundations for the
National Health System (SUS) were launched precisely at the end
of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s. SUS was delineated by
the guidelines of the Eighth National Health Conference of 1986
and was to a large extent instituted in the Brazilian
Constitution of 1988 and in the Health System Law (Law 8,080 of
September 19, 1990). It can be noted that the latter was approved
by the National Congress, during the full force of the Collor
government, which, in turn and contradictorily, represented the
victory of the neoliberal paradigm in the national strategy that
has been permeating successive economic policies implemented
since then.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, in general terms, the health sector has developed out of
step with liberalizing reforms, and has been seated within a
vigorous social and political movement (the health movement or
"party"), thereby engendering one of the most important forms of
federative alliances and participation by civil society in
national public policies (Cordeiro,<sup>7</sup> 2001). In
conceptual terms, the perception promoted by the health movement
and in academia that health could not be treated sectorally (i.e.
just as the fighting of diseases) was also important. Health was
seen as related to general living conditions and implying the
need for integrated multisectoral treatment, involving the
question of health promotion (Buss,<sup>3</sup> 2000) and, even
more comprehensively, the national development pattern
itself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, this integral view of health and its relationship
with development has never dealt with its relationship with the
strategies for industrial activity and for generating and
disseminating health innovations, except within the tradition of
research and the actions relating to technological evaluation for
health. This is from a perspective principally relating to the
regulation of the process of incorporating technologies into the
health system, by means of a variety of lines of economic
analysis of cost-benefit type.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although strategic for the rationale of the system and for
meeting health needs, this traditional way of dealing with the
question of technology and innovation in the health field does
not cover health in one other dimension. That is, health as an
important front for innovation, income and employment generation
and development, within a context of excluding and asymmetrical
globalization (Lastres et al,<sup>17</sup> 2005), in which
economic dependence appears in a variety of forms, including,
importantly, in the production of health-related goods and
services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent literature 
  on development shows that the health field constitutes an important front for 
  activities relating to science and technology, innovation, employment and income 
  generation and, therefore, economic development. It is invariably one of the 
  leading fields in national innovation systems, together with the military-industrial 
  complex (Rosemberg et al,<sup>20</sup> 1995). According to the internal logic 
  of capitalist competition (on an oligopolistic basis), company production within 
  health also constitutes a source of intense generation of asymmetry, private 
  appropriability of the fruits of technical progress and exclusion of people, 
  regions and countries. Dependence and underdevelopment therefore also leave 
  a significant structural mark on the health field, thereby restricting the evolution 
  of healthcare and the construction of a universal, equitable and comprehensive 
  system.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>2</sup></a> This makes it a 
  challenge for less developed countries to bring in new technological paradigms, 
  by means of forming an endogenous basis for health innovation and setting up 
  competitive industry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, the development pattern in the knowledge society
cannot be dealt with on one side and the health system on the
other, as if they were two independent dimensions. Separate
treatment solely following defensive logic aimed at protecting
the interests of industry, and the pressure from industry for
absorbing new products and processes in the system, has meant
that social forces, which historically have struggled for a
wide-ranging and inclusive health system in Brazil, have ended up
acting in the same direction as the neoliberal model. In turn,
this model has sought to veto the endogenous processes of
development, industrialization and overcoming dependence in less
developed countries, by means of denying active and selective
policies for the production structure in the sectors with
greatest dynamism, such as health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, a double and contradictory attack on health innovation
linked to development of the productive forces of the industrial
sectors can be seen. On the one hand, it comes from a neoliberal
line that simply discards the role of the State in industrial
policy. On the other hand, it comes from a line associated with
the field of critical thought among health policymakers that has
always defended the expansion of the role of the State for
forming a fair and universal system, but which has hardly ever
taken health to be a vital field for national development on a
company basis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question that is posed is complex, notably in the
political field, but it absolutely necessary to face up to it.
Added to the usual agenda for research and health policy, there
is the need for a new agenda focusing on drawing up policies for
developing production activities. It should involve science,
technology and, fundamentally, industrial and innovation policies
for the different sectors, including for the field of
services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To this end, it becomes necessary to incorporate the topics
connected with the development of economic activities and
industrial policy. However, this requires updating to adapt to a
society in which the competitive basis is increasingly founded on
knowledge and innovation (Cassiolato,<sup>6</sup> 1999). Among
these topics of analytical and normative nature, the following
can be highlighted:</font></p>

<ol><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <li>Study of industrial 
    and innovation dynamics in the health industries, and how they connect with 
    the healthcare system;</li>
  <li> analysis of 
    how to form an endogenous knowledge base in strategic sections of the health 
    production system, following the premise that learning takes place on the 
    basis of local, tacit and systemic capacitation, and is thus distinguished 
    from the simple process of access to and acquisition of information;</li>
  <li> formation of 
    technical-productive networks involving a wide combination of production, 
    research, funding and regulation organizations;</li>
  <li> analysis and 
    promotion of locally interlinked activities that form local productive arrangements 
    within health;</li>
  <li> continual prospecting 
    for technologies that lead to the future;</li>
  <li> studies for 
    setting up non-traditional regulatory systems in the health field, such as 
    those connected with intellectual property;</li>
  <li> efforts towards 
    introducing institutional changes in the production sector and in support 
    institutions, particularly within the sphere of funding and in the research 
    and technology organizations, thus involving a major transformation of the 
    State itself, through the flexibility, new requirements and challenges of 
    the third industrial revolution.</li></font>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE HEALTH-INDUSTRIAL 
  COMPLEX: IN SEARCH OF AN INTEGRATED VISION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is within this 
  historical, economic and political context that the concept of the health-industrial 
  complex has been developed (Gadelha,<a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a><sup>,12</sup> 
  2002, 2003). It has been sought to capture the health and economic dimensions 
  simultaneously, within a perspective of thinking out the interactions between 
  health and development, insofar as possible. This relationship goes beyond the 
  concept of a system for adequate care. It ultimately relates to its place within 
  a development strategy that simultaneously emphasizes dynamism and attenuation 
  of the economic dependence in strategic sectors, within the present historical 
  context, as exemplified by electronic equipment, biotechnology and new materials. 
  The big challenge is to build a model that allows restructuring of the national 
  productive base towards economic dynamism and overcoming the backwardness in 
  critical areas, in order to attenuate the inequality and social exclusion, as 
  seen in all segments that form part of the health complex.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The notion of the 
  health-industrial complex is simultaneously a cognitive, analytical and political 
  approach. As <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows, it forms "... a selected set 
  of productive activities that maintain intersectoral relationships of buying 
  and selling goods and services (such that they are picked up, for example, in 
  the input-product matrices in the national accounts) and/or knowledge and technologies..." 
  (Gadelha,<sup>12</sup> 2003 p. 523). These productive activities are within 
  a very particular political and institutional context that involves the provision 
  of services and the economic space to which all the health production flows. 
  Thus, this activity is completely within the complex, both because it is increasingly 
  organized on a company basis<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
  and because it configures the health market as a political and institutional 
  construction. This confers an organic nature on the complex, thereby allowing 
  connections within the same context, between the production of services and 
  goods that are as different as medications, equipment and diverse materials 
  or products for diagnostic purposes.</font></p>
<p><a name="fig1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30617f1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The perspective is systemic and therefore related to the
concept of the national innovation system within health
(Rosemberg et al,<sup>20</sup> 1995). The concept of the
health-industrial complex gives emphasis to productive activity
as a critical element of this system, considering that the core
of the country's economic vulnerability in the health field is
the fragility of the Brazilian industrial and company system. The
country's innovation capacity is determined by the potential for
transforming knowledge into new goods and services, or ones that
have been improved in their quality or production process. In
Brazil, this capacity is detached from the national scientific
and technological base and from the needs of the health system,
especially because of the low capacitation among companies for
carrying out research and development activities
(Gadelha,<sup>13</sup> 2005). From this perspective, it can be
stated that the complex constitutes an effort towards restoring
the structuralist perspective, thus emphasizing the questions of
development, dependence, industrial policy and innovation in the
health field, within the historical context of asymmetrical
globalization and the technological-industrial revolution that is
in progress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking this theoretical reference to the health-industrial
complex in the context of the national development pattern, and
focusing on its potential for innovation and the profile of
activities that are carried out in this country, this now has to
be situated with respect to the historical question of dependence
and development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most recent 
  data on the company capacity for innovation were gathered by the <i>Pesquisa 
  Industrial de Inova&ccedil;&atilde;o Tecnol&oacute;gica</i> 2003 (PINTEC - Industrial 
  Survey on Technological Innovation), (IBGE,<sup>15</sup> 2005). This recent 
  and highly relevant initiative demonstrates the low intensity of innovation 
  within health industry companies, with specific data for the pharmaceutical 
  industry ("manufacture of pharmaceutical products") and the medical-hospital 
  equipment industry, although in this latter category other products unrelated 
  to health (precision and optical equipment, industrial automation, chronometers 
  and clocks) were included.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>5</sup></a> 
  The specific data are revealing, even considering that, in relation to the mean 
  for such industrial companies, these activities are well positioned. In general 
  terms, the innovation rate seems to be high: 50.4% of the pharmaceutical companies 
  and 45.4% of the equipment companies had introduced some product or process 
  innovation between 2001 and 2003. Nevertheless, the more scattered data show 
  that these activities were largely concentrated on the acquisition of equipment 
  for improving processes and on new products and processes for companies, but 
  not for the national market. Only 0.53% of net income was spent on internal 
  research and development activities in the "innovative" pharmaceutical companies, 
  and 1.22% in the equipment companies that introduced some innovation into the 
  market. Other data, for which the detailing is outside of the scope of the present 
  article, also show the low importance of relationships with science and technology 
  institutions for carrying out research and development activities, the low level 
  of cooperation and alliances for the development of innovations, and the low 
  impact of government programs. Only 16% of innovative companies received any 
  support from the State in these two sectors, and the economic market risk ("market 
  conditions" and "economic risks") were the most critical factor that limited 
  or even blocked the more intense innovation strategies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Behind these indicators, there is a need to "open up" the
health complex through its segments, thereby seeking to capture
the profile of productive activities carried out in Brazil. For
this, the best indicators are those related to the trade balance,
since they mirror the segments in which this country is
capacitated or dependent on imports. Since the notion of the
industrial complex fundamentally relates to the productive base
existing in this country, this indicator is much more relevant
than others relating to scientific publications and even to
patents. In Brazil, these last two indicators reflect much more
the capacitation in applied research and not necessarily the
potential for innovation, which should always be correlated with
the company base.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>SITUATION OF 
  DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN TRADE</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the basis of this theoretical reference, the situation of
dependence was characterized by means of gathering and
systematizing the foreign trade data for the health complex as a
whole and for each of its segments. The information utilized was
the data available in the databases of the <i>Secretaria de
Com&eacute;rcio Exterior do Minist&eacute;rio de Desenvolvimento,
Ind&uacute;stria e Com&eacute;rico Exterior</i> (SECEX, Alice
network - Secretariat of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of
Development, Industry and Foreign Trade).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along general lines, 
  the following methodological procedures were adopted, in accordance with Gadelha<a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  (2002).</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Primary database.</i> 
    This database was concentrated on the period from 1997 to 2001, since in 1997 
    there was a significant change in the classification of commercialized products 
    resulting from the replacement of the <i>Nomenclatura Brasileira de Mercadorias</i> 
    (NBM - Brazilian Nomenclature for Merchandise ) by the <i>Nomenclatura Comum 
    do Mercosul</i> (NCM - Common Nomenclature for Mercosul).<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
    To capture what occurred during the 1990s, the basis taken was the sectoral 
    studies available, which have been shown to be adequate and sufficient for 
    the intended objectives (Negri &amp; Giovanni,<sup>18</sup> 2001). There were 
    difficulties in the NCM database regarding identification of the industrial 
    segments for health, consisting of identification problems for products when 
    they were within broader categories undefined categories such as "other items", 
    or when the use of the product is not specific to the health field. Despite 
    these difficulties, it was possible to work with this more homogenous primary 
    database without losing sight of the dynamics of these segments during the 
    initial period of commercial liberalization.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Pharmaceutical 
    segment.</i> The usual procedure of separating medications (formulated products) 
    and drugs (active agents) was adopted. In the medications industry, the items 
    shown in Chapter 30 of the NCM (the chapter where pharmaceutical products 
    are concentrated) were utilized. Medications presented in the form of doses 
    or packs for separate sale, extracts, human or animal substances prepared 
    for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes and medications that are not presented 
    as doses were included. Human blood, animal blood, antiserums, other blood 
    fractions, immunological products, vaccines, toxins and other products included 
    in the specific analysis of the vaccine, reagent, blood derivative, serum 
    and toxin segments were not taken into consideration because of the specific 
    purposes of this study.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Drugs</i>. 
    The breakdown of subitems in the chapter on organic chemical products (Chapter 
    29 of the NCM). This breakdown considers the drugs and the intermediate items 
    utilized in their production. Because these intermediate items and the drugs 
    can be used in other industries, and also because some codes may involve non-pharmaceutical 
    substances, it is possible to obtain some overestimated values. These products 
    can be used in the food and cosmetics industries, clinical analyses and even 
    in the plastics industry (additives for rubber and plastics, and coloring 
    agents). However, the risk of underestimating some values is also present 
    because the inorganic chemical products utilized in the pharmaceutical industry 
    and some organic products remained outside of the analysis. In any event, 
    despite these problems that are inherent to the classification standard adopted 
    by the NCM, the aggregated values form a good indicator for the overall performance 
    of the segment.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Equipment 
    and materials</i>. According to the methodology of Furtado &amp; Souza<sup>9</sup> 
    (2001), complemented with the breakdown utilized by the sectoral association 
    (<i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira da Ind&uacute;stria M&eacute;dico-Odontol&oacute;gica</i> 
    - ABIMO - Brazilian Association for the Medical-Dental Industry), the subitems 
    of the NCM are classified in four groups, namely: Group 1: medical-hospital 
    instruments; Group 2: medical, dental and laboratory electrical apparatus 
    and equipment; Group 3: prostheses and orthoses; Group 4: consumable materials.</font></li>
</ul>
  
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Support diagnostic/laboratory 
  reagents and reagents for determining blood groups and factors were excluded 
  from the group of consumable materials (Group 4), since these two items were 
  included in the diagnostic reagents segment. Despite the inclusions and exclusions 
  made, which were because of the specific needs of the study and the analytical 
  approach adopted, the values are very close to and comparable with those presented 
  in the literature and by the business association.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Blood derivatives.</i> 
    Blood fractions and modified immunological products, among others related 
    to blood and its derivatives, were aggregated.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Reagents 
    for diagnosing.</i> The assessment over the recent period unfortunately did 
    not allow the level of breakdown recommended for an evaluation of the competitiveness 
    of different products, since it incorporates distinctly different technological 
    bases. Nevertheless, the methodological approach sought to make a selection 
    of the products, item by item, in the different chapters and positions of 
    the NCM, including reagents for diagnosing microbe origins, reagents for determining 
    blood factors and groups, culturing media and support diagnosis reagents.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Vaccines.</i> 
    The basis taken for the analysis was vaccines for human medicine, which unfortunately 
    is not broken down in the same way as in the National Immunization Program 
    (NIP). However, it incorporates both finished goods and imported supplies, 
    and attendance for the public and private markets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Serums and 
    toxins.</i> In this case, the approach was imperfect because of the diversity 
    of use. Anti-ophidic serum, anti-tetanus serum, polyvalent antiserums, toxins, 
    antitoxins of microbial origin and other products were included, which allows 
    an overview of the evolution of this sector.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the basis of this methodology for dealing with the trade
balance within health, the information was gathered in dollars
(FOB - Free On Board) for the complex and for its segments, for
the period from 1997 to 2004. The figures were monetarily
corrected to the year 2004 on the basis of the United States
Consumer Price Index (CPI), in order to have real values as
backing for the analysis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In general terms, 
  analyzing the period as a whole, as shown in <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, it 
  appears that there was an improvement in the external conditions of the complex 
  with regard to the trade balance. The year 1998 presented the worst performance 
  regarding the trade deficit, reaching a real value of US$3.8 billion, and also 
  presented the greatest figure for imports effected by the industrial complex 
  (US$4.48 billion). In 2003, these values reached a lower level than at the end 
  of the 1990s, such that the deficit declined to less than US$2.5 billion for 
  the first time in the eight years analyzed, because of reductions in imports.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30617t1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, this picture of the trade balance for the complex
is not very encouraging when factors of a macroeconomic nature
are taken into account and a more broken down analysis by
products and groups of countries is made. From a macroeconomic
point of view, there was a clear impact on the performance of the
sector coming from the evolution of the exchange rate, which was
a stronger impact than in the evaluation made in an earlier study
(Gadelha,<sup>12</sup> 2003). Since there is a certain delayed
reaction between the evolution of the exchange rate and its
result in imports and exports, it can be inferred that the high
level of imports up to 2001 partly resulted from the excessive
valuation of the exchange rate up to 1999, which made imports
within the complex competitive (i.e. cheaper) in relation to the
local offer. In the years 2002 and 2003, the deficit reduced
markedly, to reach its lowest value in 2003, as the resultant
effect (with a time delay) from the large exchange rate
devaluation that occurred in 1999. In 2004, imports grew again,
by almost 20%, and this may have been related to the increase in
the exchange rate associated with the macroeconomic adjustment
carried out on the basis of high interest rates. This picture was
very attractive for the entry of capital, thereby leading to
upward valuation of the exchange rate starting at the beginning
of 2003.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here, a first source 
  of economic vulnerability in the health-industrial complex already appears: 
  its high dependence on external conditions and macroeconomic policy. Any movement 
  in the exchange rate may lead to an explosion in health expenditure or on imports. 
  Under a certain economic situation, exchange rate devaluation may, at least 
  initially, before generating its effects of reduction of external acquisitions 
  and increase of exports, lead to pressure on health expenditure (imports becoming 
  more expensive in Brazilian currency) that is incompatible with budget availability.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a> 
  Under another macroeconomic situation, upward valuation of the exchange rate, 
  as seen today, may lead to an explosion of imports and increased demand for 
  foreign exchange to cover health needs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In both situations, what is clear is that the economic model
for external and internal adjustments interferes directly in
health actions, thereby limiting their degree of freedom and
therefore precisely the social policies relating to access and
inclusion. The relationship between development pattern,
industrial policy and health conditions is evident, thus showing
the risk of excessive external dependence with regard to making
health policies and their objectives viable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, there 
  are also structural questions that can be shown by the data analysis, and these 
  are even more relevant from a long-term development perspective. <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/en_30617t2.gif">Table 
  2</a> shows, in terms of product lines, that the dependence on imports is concentrated 
  on the products involving higher technology and knowledge. Analysis of the origins 
  and destinations by economic blocks confirms this indication that the dependence 
  is concentrated in the most dynamic segments. Brazilian exports relating to 
  health are mostly destined for less developed blocks, such that Mercosul and 
  the "Rest of the World" accounted for 61% of external sales in 2004. On the 
  other hand, 73% of the imports came from the more developed countries of the 
  European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement area (NAFTA, United 
  States and Canada, especially).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is therefore clear asymmetry in Brazilian international
relations, thus demonstrating the technological dependence
relating to more intensively knowledge-based products coming from
the more developed countries. For such cases, there is little
sensitivity in external purchases in relation to the price and
exchange rate. To accomplish health actions, Brazil has ended up
having to import high-technology products from the more developed
countries at any cost. This is why, following the upward leap in
the trade deficit at the end of the 1980s, a time when it is
estimated on the basis of the existing literature that it was
US$700 million (Negri &amp; Giovanni,<sup>18</sup> 2001), the
level of imports into this country has never been less than US$3
billion. On the other hand, in the segments and markets that are
sensitive to price and therefore to the exchange rate, local
competitiveness is connected with products and processes of lower
technological level, as also shown in the data from
IBGE<sup>15</sup> (PINTEC 2003) that were analyzed earlier.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#fig2">Figures 
  2 to 8</a> illustrate the evolution of the segments of the complex over the 
  analysis period. In the pharmaceutical industry (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a> 
  and <a href="#fig3">3</a>), in addition to the weak performance of exports, 
  both of drugs and of medications, what is seen first is the degree of dependence 
  that exists. Putting the two segments together, pharmaceutical care has depended 
  very heavily and riskily on imports, and the summed value has never been less 
  than US$2 billion in real terms. Even when the drug segment has appeared to 
  be evolving favorably through reducing imports, this movement has at least partially 
  been compensated by increases in the imports of medications. This indicates 
  a situation that is even more unfavorable, in which instead of imports being 
  concentrated on the active agents (as occurred during the 1980s), Brazil has 
  also started to depend on finished products that were formulated abroad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the field of 
  equipment and materials (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>), which was the segment 
  that most reduced its imports over the course of the period, the dependence 
  is concentrated on electronic equipment, which certainly constitutes the goods 
  of greatest complexity and innovation potential. There is a significant industry 
  in this country that has produced good responses in relation to local demand, 
  but in the context of the microelectronic revolution and the exchange rate conditions, 
  its competitive capacity for the future clearly may be under threat.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the field 
  of technologies based on biotechnology (blood derivatives, diverse products 
  for diagnostic purposes, vaccines, serums and toxins), all companies are increasing 
  their imports, and in some cases very significantly. In the case of blood derivatives 
  (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>), the situation is explosive, with imports already 
  reaching almost US$300 million, thus tripling in real terms over the analysis 
  period. Unless urgent action is implemented regarding industrial development 
  and production,<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a> Brazil may 
  come to have serious difficulties in its successful policy for access to these 
  products.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of 
  reagents for diagnostic purposes (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>), even though 
  the data are very concentrated, the deficit remained chronic and there was a 
  very large increase in the last year of the analysis period. This situation 
  reflects a loss of opportunity to enter a technological segment that is promising 
  in terms of its capacity for interaction between the science and technology 
  system and the industry, considering that the technological leap between laboratory 
  activities and industrial activities is relatively small in relation to other 
  sectors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, in the 
  fields of vaccines (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>) and serums and toxins (<a href="#fig8">Figure 
  8</a>), there was a clear worsening in the commercial situation, with large 
  growth in imports and trade deficit. This process may partly be the result from 
  strategies adopted by the main national producers (Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz and 
  Butantan) to establish technology transfer agreements with the major world leaders 
  of the industry, through import commitments during the period of absorbing the 
  technology. However, there is the risk inherent to this type of agreement that 
  the technological frontier may shift by the end of this period, thereby bringing 
  back the question of dependence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In summary, the analysis of the trade balance of the
health-industrial complex reflects how the national pattern of
development has induced precarious specialization in the
production base and international positioning that is strongly
asymmetrical, thereby making the health system vulnerable and
dependent.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
  AND PERSPECTIVES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results allow it to be demonstrated that there is a need
to think of health in the general context of Brazil's strategy
for development and dependence reduction, which should be a
natural consequence of a broad-based conception of health (and
not a sectoral approach). The concept of the health-industrial
complex has been shown to useful within this context, in that it
precisely relates the need to join health care logic to economic
development logic within the health field. Study of this, with
emphasis on the questions of innovation and this country's
specialization pattern within the world context, has demonstrated
the analytical and normative disregard for the economic dynamics
of the sector. This brings the consequence of extreme
vulnerability for the national health policies, and may imply
risks to the objectives of universality, equity and
comprehensiveness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a political consequence, this analysis places the question
of joining together industrial policy and health policy at the
center of a strategy for developing the complex, with the
backdrop of the debating of and prospects for a new development
model for the country. This model should simultaneously give
emphasis to the dynamics of innovation and development of the
industry and to social inclusion, thereby again taking the
structuralist perspective put forward following
Furtado<sup>10</sup> (1961), within a contemporaneous
rereading.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, some important steps have been taken, albeit
insufficient. Within the field of industrial policy, the
Industrial, Technological and Foreign Trade Policy (PITCE) that
was launched in November 2004 incorporated key segments of the
health-industrial complex. Taking a broad view of the
pharmaceutical industry, including medications, drugs, blood
derivatives and vaccines, this segment was selected as one of the
four strategic options relating to fields of high dynamism and
intensity of knowledge. This policy then implied the mobilization
of significant funding instruments (such as the Development
Support Program for the Pharmaceutical Productive Chain,
Profarma, from the National Bank for Economic and Social
Development, BNDES) and other initiatives related to public
investments in medications and blood derivatives. In addition to
this, one of the other strategic options is capital goods, with
linkage to prioritize medical equipment within the scope of this
policy, by means of interventions by the recently created
<i>Ag&ecirc;ncia Brasileira de Desenvolvimento Industrial</i>
(ABDI - Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, some generic measures for improving the
institutional environment have been facilitating and adding
flexibility to the relationships between research institutions
and the private productive sector (Law 10,973 of December 2,
2004, the "Innovation Law"). The conceding of fiscal incentives
to companies, including investments in technology (Law 1,196 of
November 21, 2005, formerly known as the Provisional Measure for
tax concessions), is also acting towards creating an environment
that is favorable for innovation and investments in the health
industry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the field of health policies, it can be stated that the
question of the health-industrial complex has started to form
part of large numbers of policy documents (in the form of the
"Health-Productive Complex"). Directives have been established,
including in the current National Health Plan, and also a set of
sectoral policies, such as for generic, strategic, exceptional
and AIDS medications. Furthermore, within the Ministry of
Health's own structure, the National Secretariat for Science,
Technology and Strategic Supplies has been created, and thus
there is now a specific <i>locus</i> focusing on scientific,
technological and industrial development within health. In this
way, the industrial question is no longer being dealt with
independently from the question of knowledge generation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In summary, the present context can be seen to be much more
favorable than it was in the past. Nonetheless, there is a long
way to go towards a cognitive and political break with the
antagonistic visions that still separate health needs and the
country's needs for industrial development into two hermetically
sealed camps. Failure to utilize the purchasing power associated
with health policies for technological and industrial development
in real practice is a prominent example of how the dichotomy
between the two types of logic still persists. In this respect,
there is an essential need to overcome this dichotomy. A country
that aims to reach a condition of development and independence
requires strong and innovative industries and an inclusive and
egalitarian health system, simultaneously. This is perhaps one of
the most important strategic challenges within the Brazilian
Health System.</font></p>
