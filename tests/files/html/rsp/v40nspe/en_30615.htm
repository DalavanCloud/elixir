  and communication in public health</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the end of 2005, 
  as one of the ways of celebrating the forty uninterrupted years of publication 
  of the Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica that would be completed in the 
  following year, we started to work on planning a special issue that would be 
  launched during the 8<sup>th</sup> Brazilian Congress of Public Health and 11<sup>th</sup> 
  World Congress of Public Health, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in August 2006. 
  It seemed to us that it would be opportune for this special issue of the Revista 
  to reflect on the production and publication of scientific knowledge within 
  public health and, at the same time, to weigh up the national production within 
  this field of knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The result of this work can be appreciated on the pages that
follow. We have divided the valuable contributions received into
three parts. The articles that make up the part I relate to the
general panorama of production within science and questions
regarding scientific production. The part II brings together
articles that weigh up the national production in the fields of
the different subjects and topics within public health. In the
part III, we present an article that appraises the Revista de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica itself from scientometric
indicators.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Part I starts with a stimulating article by Reinaldo
Guimar&atilde;es on health research in Brazil, and this is
followed by an article by Carlos Gadelha that, with great
propriety, deals with the relationships between the
health-industrial complex and industrial policy. The other
articles in this first part deal with particular aspects of the
publication of knowledge that are of interest both to editors and
authors of scientific articles. Laragh Gollogly &amp; Hooman
Momen deal with the ethical questions faced by the editors of
scientific periodicals. Moyses Szklo deals with matters relating
to the quality of scientific articles. In a light-hearted
article, Cesar Victora &amp; Carmen Moreira discuss the obstacles
that authors from countries located south of the equator come up
against when they submit their articles for evaluation by editors
in the north. Alu&iacute;sio Barros, the current representative
for the field of public health in Capes (the Brazilian
university-level advancement office), presents a very interesting
analysis on the profiles of periodicals and their classification
for the purposes of assessing postgraduate programs. Miquel Porta
and contributors, in a very provocative article, highlight the
importance of epidemiological textbooks in the scientific
production within this field, from an analysis of the citations
in the ISI/Thomson Scientific bibliographic database. Finally,
Regina Castro focuses on the role of the Internet in the flow of
scientific communication and its impact on the production of
knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In part II, the state of the art in Brazilian scientific
production in the fields of the different subjects and topics
within public health is presented. Even though we have not been
able to cover all the topics of interest in a single issue, the
wide-ranging panorama furnished by these articles shows the
diversification and power of Brazilian scientific production
within public health. Everardo Nunes presents the production from
social sciences within health, Jairnilson Paim &amp; Carmem
Teixeira outline the production relating to health policies,
planning and administration, while Maur&iacute;cio Barreto
assesses the scientific production within epidemiology, thereby
embracing the three core disciplines of the field. The remaining
articles deal with thematic areas of great relevance for public
health: nutrition (article by Mar&iacute;lia Coutinho &amp;
M&aacute;rcio Lucatelli), mental health (Denise Razzouk and
contributors), workers' health (Vilma Santana), health in
relation to violence (Lilia Schraiber and contributors), gender
and health (Estela de Aquino), technological evaluation (Maria
Novaes) and oral health (Paulo Capel). The final section of this
issue is dedicated to an appraisal of the Revista de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica itself, conducted by J&uacute;lio Pereira.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The production of this special issue of the Revista de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica to commemorate its fortieth
anniversary, and its launching at the planned time, has only been
possible thanks to the prompt and favorable reception that our
invitations obtained from all the authors and the rapidity and
excellence in the submission of the manuscripts. Furthermore, the
financial support received from the Secretaria de Ci&ecirc;ncia e
Tecnologia e Insumos Estrat&eacute;gicos do Minist&eacute;rio da
Sa&uacute;de and from Secretaria de Estado da Sa&uacute;de de
S&atilde;o Paulo has been fundamental.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wishing you good 
  reading!</font></p>
