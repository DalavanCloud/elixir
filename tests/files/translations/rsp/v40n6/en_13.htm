<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  The risk factors for diseases and premature deaths are important in drawing 
  up preventive measures. This study had the aim of analyzing the risk factors 
  for death among elderly people.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> This study was carried out among participants in the SABE (Health, 
  Wellbeing and Aging) study, in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo in 2000. Interviews 
  were conducted with 2,143 elderly people (60 years old or over), using a standardized 
  questionnaire for the SABE study. The sample was obtained from census tracts, 
  in two stages, with replacements and with probability proportional to the population, 
  and with supplementation of the sample of people aged 75 years or over. The 
  final data were weighted so that they could be expanded. Between the two data 
  collection times, there were 38 deaths which comprised study sample. Logistic 
  regression was utilized for the data analysis, with a significance level of 
  5%.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The risk factors found were: locomotion difficulty, advanced 
  age, male gender, self-assessment of health as "bad" and difficulty in going 
  to the bathroom, OR=3.15; 2.93; 2.90; 2.69 and 2.51, respectively.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The results may contribute towards the adoption of preventive 
  measures for elderly people, with the aim of diminishing the expected number 
  of fatal outcomes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aging is a challenge in today's world that affects rich and
poor countries. It is estimated that around one million people
cross the threshold of 60 years of age every month, throughout
the world. It is possible that by the year 2025, out of the 11
countries with the biggest populations of elderly people, eight
will be in the category of developing countries, thus showing a
transposition of large elderly populations from developed
countries to countries that had been taken to be
characteristically young, such as Nigeria, Brazil or
Pakistan.<sup>18,20</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Latin America and the Caribbean, most countries are in an
intermediate phase of demographic transition. According to
Palloni &amp; Pel&aacute;ez,<sup>13</sup> the transition in these
countries is characterized by its rapidity. This, together with
an unstable institutional context and unfavorable economic
environment, generates conditions that make the process much more
complex than in other areas of the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil in 1940, there were 1.7 million elderly people. By
2000, this total had reached 14.5 million, i.e. a ninefold
increase. It is estimated that it will reach 30.9 million by
2020, thus placing this country's population of elderly people
among the seven biggest in the world.<sup>5</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Population groups have different risks of becoming ill,
suffering accidents or dying. The presence of certain risk
factors indicates greater likelihood that damage to health may
appear. Once identified, these factors may be treated or modified
by health actions, thereby altering the course of morbid or fatal
events.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Risk factors can be defined as conditions that predispose
towards a greater risk of developing certain health-related
events after a given time. Risk factors that present the
possibility of change and/or treatment are therefore of great
interest, and the promotion of preventive measures is a central
feature of maintaining and recovering the health of elderly
people.<sup>4,14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the growth in the elderly population, there has also been
increasing interest in establishing factors that might, singly or
jointly, better explain the risk of death that an elderly
individual presents over the short term, thereby postponing an
early fatal outcome.<sup>17</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pan-American Health Organization coordinated a multicenter
study named Health, Wellbeing and Aging (<i>Sa&uacute;de,
Bem-Estar e Envelhecimento</i> - SABE), to outline the profile of
elderly people in Latin America and the Caribbean. Argentina,
Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and Uruguay took part in
this study.<sup>1</sup> In Brazil, the study was composed of
elderly people living in the municipality of S&atilde;o Paulo in
the year 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The risk factors for death among elderly people that are often
described in the literature as immutable are age and sex. Among
the factors that are described as alterable are hospitalization,
dependence for carrying out activities of daily living, cognitive
deficit, lifestyle (such as smoking and not practicing physical
exercise), some diseases such as depression and cancer, social
isolation and the lack of family support, socioeconomic level and
negative self-assessment of health as a predictor of
mortality.<sup>16,21</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the present study had the objective of investigating the
risk factors for mortality among elderly people.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The population studied was composed of elderly people living
in the municipality of S&atilde;o Paulo in the year 2000, as part
of the SABE study conducted in Brazil. The study was
characterized as a cross-sectional, exploratory and descriptive
investigation with a quantitative approach.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sample was made up of two segments. The first of these
resulted from a draw and was based on the permanent records of 72
census tracts that are available in the Department of
Epidemiology of Faculdade de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica of
Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo (USP). This sample was taken
from the records of the National Home Sampling Survey (PNAD,
1995), which are composed of 263 census tracts drawn by cluster
sampling using the criterion of probability proportional to the
number of homes. This segment consisted of a probabilistic sample
of 1,568 interviewees. The second segment was composed of 575
people living in the districts in which the preceding interviews
had been conducted, and constituted additions made to compensate
for mortality among elderly people aged over 75 years and to
complete the desired number of interviews within this age group.
The minimum number of home drawn in the second stage was
approximated to 90. Completion of the sample of people aged 75
years and over was done by means of locating homes that were
close to the census tracts selected or, at most, within the
limits of the districts to which the selected census tracts
belonged, in accordance with the SABE study.<sup>11</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data were gathered 
  simultaneously, by means of home interviews using an instrument consisting of 
  11 thematic sections.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> In 
  the first phase, the following were gathered: personal data; cognitive assessment; 
  state of health; functional state; medications; use of and access to services; 
  family and social support network; work history and income sources; and housing 
  characteristics. In the second phase, anthropometric data were obtained and 
  flexibility and mobility tests were carried out. There was a maximum of six 
  months between the two phases.<sup>11</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each questionnaire had a weight calculated in accordance with
the corresponding census tract (weight=1/f). For the
questionnaires applied to individuals in homes that were not
drawn (age group of 75 years and over), the weighting calculation
was done in accordance with the list of the elderly population
within this age group who were living in the municipality of
S&atilde;o Paulo in 1998, and the total number of elderly people
in this age group found in the final sample for the
study.<sup>11</sup> A detailed description of the methodology
utilized can be found in Lebr&atilde;o &amp;
Duarte.<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study subjects were 38 elderly people living in the
municipality of S&atilde;o Paulo who died between the two phases
of data collection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To analyze the risk factors for death, the pertinent variables
were extracted from the questionnaire and were grouped into six
thematic types: personal information, reported diseases, health
care attendance, state of health, health conditions and
activities of daily living.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each variable was 
  grouped into two classes: zero (0) as the reference class and one (1) for the 
  contrast (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e13t1.gif">Table 1</a>). For this, the information 
  corresponding to "did not know" and "did not answer" and information not filled 
  in (missing values) was disconsidered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stepwise regression was utilized,<sup>7</sup> because in this
way the desired ranking of the relevance of each variable for
explaining the model in the presence of the other variables could
be built up. The significance level was set at 5%, both for
including each variable in the model and for calculating the
confidence intervals for the odds ratios.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For each thematic group, logistic regression was applied with
the response variable of death, thereby making it possible to
analyze the importance of the variables in each group. From the
significant variables from each of these, a general model was
built up and the relative importance of the response variables
was verified.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e13t2.gif">Table 
  2</a> shows the variables that presented statistical significance in each thematic 
  group. In the "personal information" group, the variables of age and sex were 
  the most important. Age of 75 years or over presented a risk of death approximately 
  four times greater than for the elderly people aged between 60 and 74 years. 
  Male sex implied the possibility of dying that was 2.7 times greater than for 
  female sex.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the "health care attendance" thematic group, none of the
variables analyzed presented statistical significance. Thus, it
seems that whether or not there was any attendance by the health
care system over the preceding four months, for example, there
was no influence on the occurrence of the fatal event.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "reported diseases" grouping contained the principal
diseases and complaints that affect the elderly. Among these,
cardiac disease was shown to be the most important, and this
increased the risk of death by a factor of 2.7 times.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "state of health" grouping contained the symptoms reported
by the elderly people. Of these, only "persistent cough, catarrh
or chest wheezing" was shown to be statistically significant in
the analysis, increasing the risk of death by a factor of 3.2
times, in relation to those who did not present such
symptoms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the "health conditions" grouping, the variable of health
rated as "bad" was 4.5 times more significant than the variable
of health rated as "good". The variables of smoking, drinking,
not performing physical activities and cognitive abnormalities
did not present statistically significant results for the risk of
death.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the "activities of daily living" grouping, the activities
that presented statistical significance were those related to
performing self-care activities and therefore those related to
elderly people with a greater degree of dependence. Among these,
difficulty in going to the bathroom, in feeding and in walking
across the bedroom increased the possibility of the elderly
individual dying by factors of 5.4, 3.3 and 2.8 times,
respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Difficulty in going to the bathroom, which has often been
neglected in assessments on elderly people, was shown to be very
important information, since it presented the largest risk ratio
in relation to the occurrence of a fatal event. The elderly
people with "difficulty in lying down on or getting up from a
bed" presented a negative correlation (0.24).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e13t3.gif">Table 
  3</a>, the variables of the thematic groups that maintained significance of 
  their results after again being put into the analysis model are presented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In applying the regression model by means of multivariate
analysis, it was observed that the principal risk factors for
death among the elderly people were, in decreasing order:
difficulty in locomotion, age of 75 years or over, male sex,
health self-rated as "bad", and difficulty in going to the
bathroom.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the risk factors analyzed, age is considered to be the
best indicator of the risk of dying, since the likelihood of
acquiring a chronic disease or incapacity increases with
age.<sup>16,21</sup> Likewise, functional capacity and reserves
also progressively diminish, thereby increasing the
susceptibility to health problems and consequently the
possibility of death. The mortality rates among elderly
Brazilians increase for both sexes with age. Dependence on others
for performing basic activities of daily living (feeding,
hygiene, transfer, getting dressed and sphincter control) also
increases. Chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and
osteoarticular diseases, among others, become more frequently
reported. According to the data from the present study, age of 75
years or over represented a greater risk of dying. This
characteristic is shared with developed countries, in which for
every five years added to age, the risk of death goes up by
50%.<sup>4,16,21</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sex is also indicated as a risk factor for death, such that
men are more susceptible than women. This difference in mortality
between men and women occurs as a result of a variety of factors
that, singly or jointly, cause women to live longer than men. The
reduction in mortality due to maternal causes has been one factor
contributing towards this difference. It is more a female
characteristic than a male characteristic to seek health
services, and this facilitates early treatment of diseases. There
are also the biological differences that are considered to be
protective for women, such as female hormones during fertile age,
in relation to cardiocirculatory events. The domestic
environment, where women traditionally remain, may be considered
to be a safe environment, in relation to what men are exposed to.
Environmental and occupational risks, such as work accidents,
traffic accidents and homicide, and the stress associated with
socioeconomic changes, have contributed towards greater mortality
among elderly men. The smoking habit and alcohol consumption,
which increase the risk for large numbers of diseases, were more
common among the men than among the women in the elderly
population studied. Nonetheless, these relationships might become
equal or inverted in the future, consequent to changes in female
habits and behavioral patterns.<sup>3,6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the diseases 
  reported, the circulatory system disease group presented a significantly greater 
  risk of death, and these diseases are the principal cause of death among elderly 
  people, according to national statistics.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>**</sup></a> 
  Given that coronary cardiopathy is the principal cause of death among cardiovascular 
  disease in many countries, and in view of its importance among the elderly, 
  the World Health Organization has outlined preventive strategies and strategies 
  for stabilizing clinical conditions, with the aim of avoiding illness, incapacity 
  and death resulting from these diseases.<sup>12</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hospitalization is considered to be a risk factor for death
among elderly people, because it provokes adverse effects on
health such as infections, social isolation and iatrogenic
conditions, among others. These may cause loss of independence
and autonomy, and may often lead to death.<sup>15</sup> Despite
this, in the present analysis hospitalization was shown to be
significant. Hospitalized elderly people present progressive
physical decline and, after discharge from hospital, they do not
always manage to recover their previous functional performance,
which results in high mortality rates following
hospitalization.<sup>15</sup> According to Ponzetto et
al,<sup>15</sup> loss of functional capacity is a more reliable
prognostic factor for mortality among elderly people than the
diagnoses made during hospitalization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was corroborated by the present study, in which the odds
ratios for basic activities of daily living presented
significance for the occurrence of death. Dependence on others
for performing these activities is considered to be a risk factor
for death among elderly people because such individuals have an
indispensable need for help in performing the elementary tasks of
life. Without an adequate structure for meeting their needs,
dependent elderly people can be considered to be in an at-risk
situation for worsening health and death.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Losses of cognitive abilities may alter functional capacity
and compromise other domains such as physical and social
characteristics. Deterioration among elderly individuals, whether
due to dementia or depression, leads to loss of autonomy and
independence. Moderate to severe cognitive deficit is associated
with greater risk of death among elderly people, even when
controlled for demographic conditions and chronic
comorbidities.<sup>18</sup> Nevertheless, this relationship could
not be discerned in the present study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Self-rated health, in response to the question "How do you
rate your health?" has been widely utilized in investigations on
elderly populations. Even though this a subjective assessment, it
has shown results that are similar to those from objective
evaluations of health conditions.<sup>2,8</sup> In addition to
being easily obtained information, since it only depends on the
elderly person's own opinion about his health, it was shown to be
very important, because when it was considered bad, the
likelihood of that elderly person dying became greater.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In reviews of the literature, Benyamini &amp;
Idler<sup>2</sup> and Idler &amp; Benyamini,<sup>8</sup> showed
that in most studies conducted since the 1980s, the elderly
people who self-rated their health as bad presented greater
incidence of death than did those who considered it to be
excellent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among elderly people, self-rated health may present greater
sensitivity for men than for women. Since women live longer than
men and experience more years with diseases and incapacities,
they tend to rate their health more negatively than do men, but
do not necessarily die because of this, over the short term.
Thus, negative self-rated health expressed by women may be more
associated with quality of life. On the other hand, when men rate
their health negatively, they present a greater risk of
succumbing to a fatal event.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diseases relating to the respiratory system are the second
biggest cause of hospitalization and the third biggest cause of
death in Brazil. The findings from the present study reinforce
the need for there to be monitoring of elderly people with
chronic respiratory conditions, and for increases in prevention
services relating to vaccinations for this age group and their
principal communicants, against colds and pneumonia. These should
also be monitoring of circulating viruses, to contribute towards
improving the composition of such vaccines offered to this
population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smoking, drinking and not doing physical activities are more
associated with the risk of developing diseases such as
cardiovascular diseases than directly with the risk of death.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The negative correlation between bedridden elderly people and
death leads to the inference that dependence requires greater
attention, which seems to act as a protection factor against the
occurrence of fatal events. On the other hand, individuals who
are moderately dependent, i.e. who have difficulty in locomotion
and transfer, presented greater risk of death. The results now
presented indicate that there is a need for greater reflection
regarding prioritization of care and reorganization of
services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The variables indicated by the model utilized may assist in
building up an instrument for assessing the risk of death,
thereby contributing towards the prevention of fatal events.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elderly people who present greater risk of death ought to
deserve differentiated attention from the bodies responsible for
organizing the services destined for this population and their
families, such that this would result in decreased premature
death among these elderly people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is not intended through this that life should be prolonged
at any cost. On the contrary, the idea is to avoid deaths
associated with lack of health care, structure and resources, in
a society that is rapidly aging and where elderly people's needs
are often inadequately met, thereby increasing the possibilities
of worsening health, incapacity, compromised quality of life, and
death.</font></p>
