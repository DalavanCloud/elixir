<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  the increase in the number of AIDS cases among women has lead to an increase 
  in the maternal-infant transmission of human acquired immunodeficiency virus. 
  Measures for the control of this type of transmission were implemented in Brazil 
  in 1996. The aim of the present study was to analyze time trends in maternal-infant 
  transmission of AIDS among Brazilian children.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> The present study included children born in Brazil between 1990 
  and 2001. We used the database of notified AIDS cases in children 13 years of 
  age or younger between 1990 and 2004. Exponential regression models adjusted 
  to the time series provided the annual variation rates and observed and expected 
  values for the period.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> We found a significant increasing trend for cases born prior 
  to the year in which antiretroviral therapy was introduced, with an increase 
  rate of about 12% (t&lt;0.003) per year. Rates from different states ranged 
  from 5.9% to 31%. The analysis of expected and observed cases for each of the 
  country's five Regions showed a reduction in the number of cases among children 
  born from 1997 onwards, with a progressive year-to-year reduction. The number 
  of notified cases among children born in 2001 was less than 10% the number of 
  expected cases.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The results obtained suggest a favorable response the implementation 
  of policies for the prevention of maternal-infant HIV transmission in Brazil, 
  as observed in other parts of the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The patterns of dissemination of infection by the human
acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have changed due to the
predominance of heterosexual transmission. This has been decisive
for the increase in the incidence of the disease among women. In
its turn, the increase in the number of cases among women led to
an increase in maternal-infant transmission of HIV infection,
with consequent increase in the number of cases of AIDS in
children worldwide. In Brazil, about 84% of pediatric AIDS cases
&#150; that is, cases among children up to 13 years of age &#150; is due to
maternal-infant transmission.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The probability of maternal-infant transmission of HIV
infection has been calculated in a number of
studies.<sup>4-6,10,11</sup> The majority of cases of
transmission &#150; roughly 65% &#150; occur during labor and delivery, and
the remaining 35% occur during intrauterine life, especially
during the last weeks of pregnancy. In addition, breastfeeding
represents an additional risk of 7-22%. Studies<sup>5,6,10</sup>
show that a number of factors are associated with increased risk
of maternal-infant transmission of HIV. Of these, major risk
factors include the time between the rupture of amniotic
membranes and delivery and the amount of virus in the mother's
cervical-vaginal secretions and breast milk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of Aids Clinical Trial Group Protocol 076 (ACTG
076), in 1994, have proven the effectiveness of zidovudine (AZT)
for the reduction of maternal-infant transmission in 67.5% of
cases.<sup>5</sup> Based on this evidence, in the same year, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a
recommendation for the use of AZT by HIV+ women in the second and
third trimesters of pregnancy and during labor, and by children
during the first six weeks of life.<sup>4</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering the 
  growth of the epidemic in the female population, the Brazilian Ministry of Health 
  published, in 1995, specific regulations on the prevention of maternal-infant 
  transmission, establishing this as one of the priorities of the National Program 
  for STD/AIDS (PN-DST/AIDS).<sup>14</sup> However, the recommendations included 
  in this publication were only effectively implemented with their updating and 
  inclusion in the manuals for treatment of adults and children infected with 
  HIV, in 1997 (Ministerial Technical Decree no. 874/97<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>). 
  Appropriate conducts for antenatal and delivery care of HIV+ women are included 
  in the "Recommendations for the Prophylaxis of Maternal-Infant transmission 
  of HIV and Antiretroviral Therapy of Pregnant Women," a document periodically 
  revised by the PN-DST/AIDS.<sup>3,7,14,</sup><a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an attempt to strengthen this control measure, another
strategy<sup>9</sup> for the evaluation of the use of the
maternal-infant transmission prevention protocol was the
inclusion of the surveillance of HIV+ mothers and exposed
children as a compulsory notification event, in 2000 (Decree n.
993/2000). Recently, with the intent of implementing measures for
the reduction of morbidity and mortality related to congenital
syphilis and maternal-infant HIV infection, the Ministry of
Health implemented the <i>Projeto Nascer &#150;
Maternidades</i>,<sup>9</sup> within the scope of the National
Unified Healthcare System (Decree n. 2,104 GM, 19 November
2002).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the 
  estimated number of pregnant women infected with HIV is around 16,410, i.e., 
  0.4% of the population of pregnant women.<sup>2</sup> The rate of maternal-infant 
  transmission has fallen in recent years, considering the country as a whole: 
  from 16% in 1997,<sup>13</sup> before the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, 
  to 7% in 2002.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> A study conducted 
  in Rio de Janeiro in 2001<sup>11</sup> showed a reduction of about 3% in maternal-infant 
  transmission among pregnant women participating in an intervention program that 
  followed all recommendations made by the Ministry of Health. In 2002, the <i>Sentinela-Parturiente</i> 
  study<sup>2</sup> showed an effective coverage of the detection of HIV infection 
  during pregnancy of about 52% for the country as a whole. Sociogeographic inequalities 
  become patent when comparing the country's Northeast (24%) and South (71%) regions; 
  illiterate mothers (19%) with those with schooling above the elementary level 
  (64%); and women who gave birth in small cities (37%) with those that delivered 
  in cities with over 500,000 inhabitants (66%).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, in order to evaluate current measures for the
control and prevention of maternal-infant transmission of HIV
infection, the aim of the present study was to analyze trends in
cases of AIDS among Brazilian children up to age 13 years.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For data analysis, we used the database of notified AIDS cases
among children aged 13 years or less considered as due to
maternal-infant transmission, registered in the National System
for Notification Events (<i>Sistema Nacional de Agravos de
Notifica&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> &#150; SINAN), between 1990 and April
2004.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the time trend analysis, we considered cases occurred in
the selected period, according to year of birth. In other words,
we considered the cohort of cases of AIDS notified until 2004
with birth dates between 1990 and 2001. The choice of cutoff
point for year of birth was due to the concern with avoiding
errors due to delays in notification. According to Szwarcwald et
al<sup>12</sup> (2001), about 30% of HIV-infected children are
notified as cases of AIDS only in the two first years following
birth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of exponential regression models, adjusted to the
time-series of children with birth date between 1990 and 1996
allowed us to calculate annual variation rates and to
statistically test time trends. Thus, it was also possible to
estimate expected values for the entire period, allowing for a
comparison between the observed and expected values for children
born between 1997 and 2001.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We analyzed 8,703 cases of AIDS in children aged 13 years or
less, notified to SINAN until April 2004. The majority of cases
occurred in the Southeast (61.7%) and South (25.2%) Regions,
confirming the magnitude of the problem in these Regions in
relation to the number of cases of HIV infection and AIDS in the
Country.<sup>3,15</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#tab1">Table 
  1</a> presents observed and expected cases of maternal-child transmission of 
  AIDS for the entire country. We highlight the fact that the rate of increase 
  in the number of cases in the period before the introduction of antiretroviral 
  therapy was of about 12% (mean annual variation rate = 0.12, p=0.003). For children 
  born in 1997, the number of cases notified represented less than 34.8% of the 
  expected cases, a phenomenon which repeats itself progressively, with observed 
  cases representing as little as 10% of the expected number for children born 
  in 2001.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An analysis of 
  time trends in maternal-infant transmission by Region shows that, prior to the 
  introduction of antiretroviral therapy, there was a yearly increase in the number 
  of cases in all Brazilian Regions, with mean annual variation rates ranging 
  from 5.9% to 31%. The states of S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, both in 
  the Southeast Region, and at the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil, showed 
  the smallest increase rates in countrywide (5.9 and 8.9%, respectively). On 
  the other hand, rates in all the States of the South Region were above 20%. 
  The state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo registered the highest mean annual variation 
  rate among all analyzed states (31%) (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of 
  the time series in regard to the number of observed and expected cases for each 
  of the country's Regions shows a reduction in the number of AIDS cases notified 
  among children born from 1997 onwards, with numbers falling progressively every 
  year (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are still failures in the early detection of HIV among
Brazilian pregnant women, as indicated by the
<i>Sentinela-Parturiente</i> study.<sup>8</sup> Nonetheless, the
results obtained in the present study consistently show a
progressive reduction in the number of expected cases of AIDS due
to maternal-infant transmission among children born from 1997
onwards. This period coincides with the massive and universal
introduction of the prophylactic measures recommended by the
PN-DST/AIDS, especially with regard to the administration of
antiretroviral drugs to HIV+ pregnant women and to exposed
newborns. The number of cases notified for children born in 2001
in the entire country represented only 10.1% of the expected
number of cases. In other words, if the trend observed between
1990 and 1996 was maintained, with its 12% mean annual growth
rate, a total 2,241 cases of AIDS would be expected in children
born in 2001; however, only 226 cases of the disease were
recorded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reduction in 
  the number of expected cases occurred in all Regions. In 2001, for instance, 
  reductions in relation to expected cases ranged from approximately 87% in the 
  North and Northeast Regions to over 93.7% in the South Region. These differences 
  may be partly explained by the findings of a study showing differences in access 
  to antenatal care services between the different Regions.<sup>8</sup> In spite 
  the reductions, the rates of maternal-infant transmission of HIV were higher 
  in Regions with more precarious indicators of maternal care, namely the North 
  and Northeast.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reduction in the number of children with AIDS after 1997
is due to the increase in the coverage of measures for the
prevention and control of AIDS during antenatal care and delivery
in Brazil, corroborating the results obtained by other
authors.<sup>7,11</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, the universal adoption of antiretroviral
therapy for pregnant women and children exposed to HIV has
prevented around 6,000 new cases of HIV among Brazilian children
born between 1997 and 2001. The results obtained by the analysis
of the time series of AIDS cases due to maternal-infant
transmission, according to year of birth, allowed for the
identification of a decreasing trend in the number of pediatric
AIDS cases, which reflects the impact of the prophylactic
measures adopted in a global and efficient manner. The greater
coverage of these measures, combined with greater adequacy of
antenatal, delivery, and puerperal care, will surely contribute
in a more rapidly effectively to the interruption of avoidable
cases of maternal-infant transmission throughout the Brazilian
territory.</font></p>
