<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recognizing the HIV/AIDS pandemic as an unprecedented
worldwide emergency and one of the greatest challenges to life
and the enjoyment of human rights, the United nations called on
member states to reflect on this matter. In June 2001, around 20
years after the first AIDS cases were recorded, the United
Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS (UNGASS
HIV/AIDS) was held in New York. The Session culminated in the
drafting of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV and
AIDS:<sup>4</sup> a document that reflected the consensus between
189 countries, including Brazil, and stated some essential
principles for an effective response to the epidemic. The
Declaration recognized that economic, racial, ethnic,
generational and gender inequalities, among others, were factors
that boosted vulnerability and, whether acting separately or in
synergy, favored HIV infection and the onset and evolution of
AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Declaration of Commitment on HIV and AIDS has become
transformed into a tool for reaffirming the urgency and necessity
of promoting the solidarity that the epidemic demands. It aims
towards better management of the actions and resources destined
for controlling HIV and AIDS<sup>5</sup> and towards social
control over public HIV/AIDS policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The document emphasizes the importance of promoting actions
that combat discrimination against people with HIV; that reduce
the vulnerability of the segments of the population that are most
exposed to becoming infected and ill; and that support AIDS
orphans. It adopts the paradigm that governments have a
responsibility to ensure access to treatment and prevention as
indissociable actions, and recognizes that results cannot be
achieved solely by governments. Thus, it reaffirms the importance
of involving civil society at all stages of constructing the
response, thereby reinforcing the principle that people living
with HIV/AIDS should participate in the process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Declaration is divided into 11 chapters: leadership;
prevention; care, support and treatment; human rights; reduction
of vulnerability; orphans and children who are vulnerable to
HIV/AIDS; reduction of the social and economic impact;
investigation and development; regions affected by conflicts and
natural catastrophes; financial resources; and monitoring and
assessment. Each chapter includes commitments and targets to be
achieved at the national, continental and global levels, using
the years 2003, 2005 and 2010 as reference points.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2003, as foreseen, the first assessment of the progress
towards fulfilling the targets and commitments taken on was made.
Out of the 189 signatory countries, 103 submitted national
monitoring reports to the United Nations.<sup>5</sup> Most of the
reports presented a variety of limitations regarding the quality
of the information and the participation of civil society in
drawing them up. According to the United Nations itself, these
limitations made it difficult to analyze the progress in
controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic achieved around the world over
this period, and to come to valid conclusions. One example of
this is that fewer than 20% of the countries presented data that
were broken down according to sex, age and geographical
regions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In June 2005, with the objective of assessing the targets set
for that year, the United Nations held a preparatory meeting for
the second progress review on the targets and
commitments.<sup>6</sup> This second review is scheduled for June
2006, and is also known as UNGASS+5. The conclusions from this
preparatory meeting revealed challenges that were even greater
that those on which the adoption of the Declaration of Commitment
in 2001 were based. In 2005 alone, almost five million new cases
occurred; the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)
registered 3.1 million deaths and around 40 million people living
with HIV/AIDS all around the world,<sup>3</sup> of whom the great
majority were in poor and developing countries. Even though these
results were preliminary, they showed that, generally,
governments were still not basing their actions on the
recognition of human rights, or mobilizing at the speed and with
the technical quality needed to face up to the epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2006, during UNGASS+5, the obstacles and opportunities for
implementing the Declaration will be reviewed, on the basis of
the reports from each country and the various consultations that
have been made regarding the attainment of universal access to
support, treatment and prevention. The meeting will also have the
objective of renewing the global political commitment towards
facing up to the epidemic. It will involve different sectors of
the international community: governments, civil society, private
sector and people living with HIV/AIDS. A session of hearings for
civil society will be held, with the expectation that this
occasion will enable an exchange of views and opinions between
representatives from civil society and the member states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, civil society has had active participation in this
process since 2001, and formed part of the Brazilian government's
official delegation to UNGASS HIV/AIDS. In 2003, the deadline set
for handing over the first national reports to the United
Nations, there were initiatives from the government and from
civil society aimed at following up how the commitments and
targets in the Declaration were being put into effect. At that
time, the Ministry of Health sent a report to the United Nations
that was subsequently discussed nationally. During this same
period, the non-governmental organization (NGO) Gestos (from
Pernambuco) and the S&atilde;o Paulo NGO/AIDS Forum held the
First Brazilian UNGASS Forum, which became a formal space for
civil society to discuss and follow up the Declaration in Brazil.
To date, there have been three national UNGASS forums, two state
forums and one regional forum, held with support from the
National STD/AIDS Program and from UNAIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To monitor the targets established for 2005, two strategies
were voiced by Brazilian civil society. The first, organized
within the sphere of the UNGASS forums, consisted of conducting
the case study "Monitoring UNGASS &#150; the View from Civil Society
regarding Access and Treatment", which had support from the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNAIDS/Brazil. The
topics analyzed in the study were: the capacity to produce
antiretroviral drugs; civil society's activities; strengthening
for the situation of seropositive women; and respect for the
human rights of the populations that were most excluded from
comprehensive healthcare. The results indicated the need for
effective use of legal instruments to ensure sustainable
universal access to antiretroviral drugs, such as utilization of
compulsory licensing and review of the patents law itself; the
existence of problems relating to the logistics of drug
acquisition, supply and distribution; and the need to improve the
quality of comprehensive care for people living with HIV and
AIDS. The document emphasized the importance of the participation
by civil society in constructing the responses to overcome these
problems.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second strategy, coordinated by the S&atilde;o Paulo
Institute of Health, Gestos and the AIDS Support and Prevention
Group of S&atilde;o Paulo (GAPA/SP), with support from the Ford
Foundation and the National STD/AIDS Program, consisted of bring
together non-governmental organizations and researchers in
universities, institutes and other knowledge-producing entities
in the country. The objective was to deepen the analyses on the
Brazilian response towards meeting the commitments expressed in
the Declaration, utilizing the extensive set of information on
the epidemic that has been produced in Brazil as the reference
point.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For this, researchers in different fields of activity were
invited to conduct analyses on the indicators available for each
chapter of the document. The studies produced were presented and
debated during the Monitoring and Assessment Seminar on Target
and Commitment Fulfillment relating to the United Nations
Declaration of Commitment on HIV and AIDS, which was held in
S&atilde;o Paulo on November 21 and 22, 2005, with participation
by activists within the movement for combating AIDS, public
administrators and researchers. A synthesis from these
studies<sup>2</sup> was sent to the Ministry of Health, and these
analyses of the National STD/AIDS Program, together with the case
study conducted by civil society, constituted the Brazilian
government's official report to the United Nations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The articles presented here are the product from this
extensive process of debate. Together, they show that the targets
put forward by the Declaration of Commitment have mostly been
taken on by Brazil and that some of them had already been met as
early as 2001, when they were agreed on. They therefore point
towards what seems to be Brazil's greatest challenge in the
context of UNGASS HIV/AIDS: the revision and adaptation of the
targets to national realities in such a way that they can be
effectively transformed into an instrument to guide the national
response.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The supplement starts with an analysis of the trends within
the epidemic in Brazil, in a paper by Dourado et al that is
complemented with regard to the specific characteristics of
mother-to-child HIV transmission in the paper by Brito et al. In
both these articles, the contrast in the dynamics of the epidemic
before and after the advent of highly active antiretroviral
therapy (HAART) stands out. Completing this section analyzing the
recent trends in the Brazilian epidemic, Fran&ccedil;a
J&uacute;nior et al analyze the question of AIDS orphans and
children who are vulnerable to the epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In two interrelated articles, Bastos &amp; Hacker review and
analyze the main findings from Brazilian research over the course
of two decades of activities in a very wide variety of fields of
knowledge, and at its interface with innovation and technological
development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The economic dimension of the Brazilian response, the
sustainability of some of its fundamental policies and the
challenges posed within a context of budget restrictions, growing
demand for resources and protection for intellectual property in
the form of patents on new drugs and medications are analyzed in
the articles by Grangeiro et al and Teixeira. These questions are
taken up again in the paper by Portela &amp; Lotrowska, in the
specific dimension of assistance for people living with AIDS.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper by Oliveira deals with the topic of the overlapping
dimensions of gender and social inequalities within the contexts
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and respect for and promotion of human
rights. These questions are reflected in the paper by Villela
&amp; Veloso, within the wide-ranging perspective of the
participation of civil society in the Brazilian response to the
epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The need for continual monitoring of the indicators put
forward by UNGASS has led to the need to construct speedy
interactive systems for accessing up-to-date data. This question,
which is mentioned in the abovementioned text by Villela &amp;
Veloso, is taken up again in detail by Barbosa Junior et al.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question of leadership in the response to the HIV/AIDS
epidemic within the national and worldwide contexts is dealt with
by Berm&uacute;dez &amp; Seffner. The paper by Paiva et al takes
up these questions again within the sphere of prevention and
vulnerability reduction initiatives implemented by different
public entities and by civil society, as a central part of the
Brazilian response to the epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, through disseminating these analyses, the intention is
to expand the knowledge of the commitments agreed on in the
United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV and AIDS. This
has the aim of refining the debate on the achievements attained
by the country over the course of three decades of the epidemic,
and eliciting reflections from civil society regarding the
challenges in combating AIDS that have been identified as the
main ones for the Brazilian response. Within a context in which
Brazil continues to be internationally prominent because of its
recognized model for responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is
hoped that such reflections may bring in contributions that
extrapolate the local debate and indicate the advances that
Brazil needs, in the light of its proactive position within the
international debate.</font></p>
