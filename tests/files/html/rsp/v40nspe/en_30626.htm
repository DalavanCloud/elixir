<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVES:</b> 
  To analyze the growth of epidemiological research in Brazil in comparison to 
  the total number of indexed publications worldwide and from several Latin American 
  and Caribbean countries.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> 
  A Boolean combination of epidemiological key words was used to search the MEDLINE/PubMed 
  database for articles published between 1985 and 2004. These articles were divided 
  into 4 time periods: 1985-9, 1990-4, 1995-9, and 2000-4.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> 
  Of the total 211,727 articles identified in the MEDLINE/PubMed database, 1,952 
  (0.9%) were related to Brazil. The number of articles increased 12-fold throughout 
  the period (from 91 to 1,096), and more than doubled (0.54% to 1.1%) if considered 
  in relation to the total number of indexed articles. This growth was accompanied 
  by diversification of the subjects addressed. The fields of infectious diseases 
  and mother-child health, which predominated during the first period (74%), represented 
  only a minority of articles in the last period. There was a noteworthy increase 
  in the Brazilian output when compared to that of other Latin American and Caribbean 
  countries.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> 
  Our results corroborate previous evidence of the intense growth of epidemiological 
  research in Brazil in the last two decades. This growth was more intense than 
  mean growth worldwide, and much greater than that found in other Latin American 
  countries. Therefore, Brazilian scientific output in the epidemiology field 
  is showing a growth pattern similar to that of other scientific areas in the 
  country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scientometric studies have been showing significant growth in
Brazilian scientific production in recent decades. The main
source for such measurements has been the bibliographical
database compiled by the Institute for Scientific
Information/Thomson Scientific (ISI/Thomson), under the Web of
Science interface<i>.</i> According to this source, the
production of scientific articles in Brazil in the last two
decades has increased at twice the mean global rate. The
proportion of articles coming from Brazil indexed in the Web of
Science database, which two decades ago was approximately 0.5%,
now approaches 1.5% of global output. A similar growth pattern
has been observed other analyses of research in the health
area.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of these studies 
  report that, generally speaking, the growth of Brazilian scientific production 
  in recent decades has been greater than that of other Latin American countries.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  A bibliometric study<sup>12</sup> that divided publications in the health field 
  into biomedicine, clinical practice, and collective health showed intense growth 
  in scientific production between 1973 and 1992. In relation to other Latin American 
  countries, Brazil ranked first in production in the field of biomedicine, with 
  38.7% of all published articles (followed by Argentina, with 29.6%); in the 
  field of clinical practice, production in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico was 
  similar (26.6%, 27.5%, and 22,7%, respectively); however, in the field of collective 
  health, Brazilian production accounted for 60.7% of published articles, with 
  a substantial lead over Argentina (13.5%) and Mexico (11.2%), in second and 
  third places, respectively.<sup>12</sup> This study also showed that epidemiological 
  production was centered on infectious diseases and mother-infant health; this 
  is in contrast with worldwide production, in which chronic diseases were already 
  the foremost topic of investigation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding epidemiology specifically, the description and
analysis of its growth and trends in Brazil were the subject of a
few but important studies.<sup>5,10,13</sup>
Teixeira<sup>13</sup> analyzed the abstracts of studies presented
at the first three Brazilian epidemiology congresses, and
identified some important characteristics: significant
participation of health care professionals, collaboration between
academics and such professionals, and the existence of a small
core of epidemiologists that presented abstracts at the three
congresses investigated. Guimar&atilde;es et al,<sup>10</sup>
using the 2000 Research Directory of <i>Conselho Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e Tecnol&oacute;gico</i> (CNPq
- National Council for Scientific and Technological Development),
showed that epidemiological research topics were quite well
structured, and were present in at least 176 research groups,
most of which were in the field of collective health. However,
their most interesting finding was that part of these groups did
not belong to the health field, indicating the multidisciplinary
trend typical of Brazilian epidemiological research.
Barreto<sup>5</sup> analyzed the foundations of the intense
growth of epidemiology in Brazil, highlighting the strong
interaction between academic research and health care service
practice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of the present study was to analyze the growth of
scientific production in epidemiology in Brazil and to discuss
qualitative aspects of this growth, as well as its implications
and trends.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We carried out 
  a survey of epidemiological articles produced in Brazil and published in journals 
  indexed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database between 1985 and 2004. Even though it 
  favors North-American publications, the MEDLINE/PubMed database is the greatest 
  available bibliographical database for the health area with global coverage. 
  A number of relevant Brazilian health science journals are indexed in this database, 
  whereas others, just as relevant, are not. Specifically in the field of collective 
  health, two important journals &#150; <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> 
  and <i>Cadernos de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> &#150; are indexed, while 
  other journals of growing importance in this area, such as and <i>Ci&ecirc;ncia 
  e Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i> are still not in the database. At the international 
  level, important epidemiological journals are indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed (American 
  Journal of Epidemiology, International Journal of Epidemiology, Epidemiology, 
  Annals of Epidemiology, Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Journal 
  of Clinical Epidemiology, Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, Epidemiolgy 
  and Infection, Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, European Journal 
  of Epidemiology, Journal of Epidemiology, Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study covered a period of two decades, divided
into four subperiods: 1985-1989, 1990-1994, 1995-1999, and
2000-2004. In order to characterize an article as
"epidemiological", the following keywords were used, in Boolean
combination: <i>(epidemiology OR risk) AND (ecological OR
geographical OR aggregate OR time-series OR trend OR cohort OR
transversal OR cross-sectional OR case-control OR trial OR
intervention OR etiological).</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to identify articles related to Brazil, we included
the term "<i>and Brazil</i>" to the combination described above.
Data were retrieved for entries between January 1<sup>st</sup> to
December 31<sup>st</sup> of the first and last years of the
analyzed subperiod. For this search, the studied time period was
defined in the "Limits" tab of the PubMed search interface. The
number of articles published in English (or in any other
language) was obtained using another field in the "Limits" tab.
In order to verify the consistency of the information thus
obtained, we also carried out searches using the same Boolean
combinations in the Web of Science database.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the entire 
  1985-2004 period, we retrieved 211,727 articles from the MEDLINE/PubMed database, 
  of which 1,958 (0.9%) were related to Brazil. Of these, 91 articles (0.5% of 
  the total) were from the 1985-1989 period, whereas 1,096 (1.1% of the total) 
  were from the 2000-2004 period, indicating an approximately 12-fold increase 
  in the number of articles, and a twofold increase in terms of the percentage 
  of articles indexed in the database. Of the total 1,958 articles related to 
  Brazil, 741 (38%) were published in Brazil, 513 (26%) in the United States, 
  361(18%) in Great Britain, and the remainder (343) in other countries. <a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a> shows the growing trend for articles published by Brazilians in Brazilian, 
  North-American, and British journals. There is also a predominance of the English 
  language among articles by Brazilian authors indexed in the MEDLINE/PubMed database, 
  totaling 71%. This high proportion remained stable throughout all periods studied. 
  Of all articles published in Brazilian journals, 33% were in English. The ascending 
  curve seen in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> was the consequence of an increase 
  in the different types epidemiological of studies. Thus, if we consider more 
  complex studies &#150; such as those with longitudinal design &#150; alone, 
  we see an increase similar to that seen for epidemiological studies in general. 
  In the 1985-1989 period, we identified 21 longitudinal studies, increasing to 
  61, 136, and 275 in the following subperiods, representing 23%, 25%, 26%, and 
  25% of all studies in each period.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The same search 
  when conducted in the Web of Science database retrieved a smaller number of 
  articles (742), with only a single article in the 1985-1989 period. The growing 
  trend was similar to that observed using MEDLINE/PubMed data (<a href="#fig2">Figure 
  2</a>).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When compared to 
  global production (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), in spite of the substantial 
  difference in magnitude, growth across the two decades analyzed was faster in 
  Brazil than it was worldwide. Thus, whereas in 1985-1989 Brazilian production 
  accounted for 0.5% of global production, in the subsequent subperiod this proportion 
  increased, reaching 0.7% in 1990-1994, 0.9% in 1995-1999, and as much as 1.1% 
  in 2000-2004, corresponding to a relative growth of more than twice that observed 
  globally. <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> shows Brazilian epidemiological production 
  in the 1985-2005 period in relation to production in major Latin American countries. 
  When compared to most countries analyzed, the difference between production 
  in Brazil increased considerably throughout the period. Interestingly, the production 
  of epidemiological articles in Mexico, which in 1985-1989 was the only country 
  with greater production than Brazil, was significantly lower than Brazilian 
  production in the 2000-2004 period.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning the 
  topics of epidemiological articles published in Brazil, in the first period 
  (1985-9), 74% of articles addressed subjects related to infectious diseases 
  and mother-child health, and the remaining 26% corresponded to 24 articles on 
  cancer, heart disease, mental disorders, and environmental and nutritional problems. 
  This scenario became inverted in the 2000-2004 period, with only 40% of articles 
  addressing infectious diseases and mother-child health, and the remaining 60% 
  &#150; approximately 700 articles &#150; being dedicated to other epidemiological 
  topics, with important increases in the fields of violence and oral health.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of the present study corroborate evidence
previously presented in other studies of the growth of
epidemiological research in Brazil in the last two decades. A
potential turning point in this process is the year of 1984,
which saw the first national meeting on teaching and research in
epidemiology, and when the Epidemiology Committee of the
<i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de
P&oacute;s-Gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o em Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i>
(Abrasco - Brazilian Association of Collective Health
Postgraduate Programs) was created.<sup>1</sup> This committee
would become a major stimulus for the development of Brazilian
epidemiology. We also found that growth was more intense in
Brazil than it was worldwide, and that it was greater than that
of other Latin American countries. We therefore conclude that
scientific production in epidemiology in Brazil is showing growth
patterns similar to those found in other fields of scientific
knowledge.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The MEDLINE/PubMed database has greater coverage of the health
and collective health areas than does Web of Science. Access to
the on-line version of MEDLINE/PubMed is universal and free,
making it the most accessed bibliographic source for the health
area. However, the ISI/Thomson database has been used more often
in scientometric studies, among other reasons because it includes
journals from other scientific fields, thus allowing for
comparisons to be made between the different areas of science.
However, ISI/Thomson is more restrictive in the coverage of
indexed journals, and shows major differences from
MEDLINE/PubMed. The most important of these is that, whereas
MEDLINE/PubMed is a governmental organ linked to the United
States National Library of Medicine, ISI/Thomson is a private
enterprise, whose transparency has been seriously
questioned.<sup>11</sup> ISI/Thomson, however, carries out other
tasks of great importance to scientometrics, producing measures
of the impact of scientific journals published in its database
(impact factors), in addition to cataloguing the number of
citations that each indexed article has had in subsequent
scientific articles (i.e., in articles published in other
journals included in this same database). The majority of
North-American and British journals in which Brazilians most
frequently publish, in the fields of epidemiology, collective
health, or general health alike, are indexed in both
MEDLINE/PubMed and ISI/Thomson. However, this is not the case for
Brazilian journals, since, as already mentioned, in the field of
collective health, only <i>Cadernos de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i> and <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i> are indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed, and only the
latter is indexed in ISI/Thomson.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the limitations of the present bibliographical search,
we believe to have succeeded in attaining our major objective,
which was to show the growth and trends in publication, even
though the magnitude of production (number of published articles)
may eventually be greater than that found in the present
study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guimar&atilde;es et al<sup>10</sup> documented the large
number of researchers with PhDs in epidemiology in activity in
research groups throughout Brazil. In the 1980's and 1990s, these
authors identified over 90 doctors inserted into research groups
abroad (especially in the United States and England). In its
turn, the development of postgraduate programs in collective
health, many of which concentrate on epidemiology, has led to the
training of a growing number of epidemiologists from Brazil and
from other countries, especially from Latin America and Africa.
Obviously, such a large number of researchers is in itself a
propelling factor for scientific production. Barata &amp;
Goldbaum,<sup>3</sup> while analyzing the characteristics of CNPq
researchers in the field of public health, observed that the
majority of these are epidemiologists, and that the proportion of
those trained outside Brazil is decreasing markedly, reflecting a
change in place of training between the different generations of
epidemiologists.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, the expansion of the scientific production in
epidemiology detected in the present study, based mainly on the
MEDLINE/PubMed database, is consistent with the findings of
previous surveys using other sources. A natural and immediate
unfolding of the realization of such increase in scientific
production in epidemiology would be a qualitative analysis of
production, centered on issues such as its impact on
international epidemiology and its meaning in terms of knowledge
of the health conditions of the Brazilian population and
implementation of policies and measures to improve them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International impact deserves special attention, since it is
connected to the fundamental characteristic of scientific
knowledge: becoming a universal good, to be shared
internationally. We found that about 71% of Brazilian scientific
articles indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed are written in English,
allowing them to be read by researchers from other countries more
easily than if they were published only in Portuguese. Language
of publication is a polemic issue. One question in this context
is what leads an author to choose an international rather than a
Brazilian journal. Even in Brazilian journals, an important
proportion (33%) of publications in epidemiology are in English.
Certain Brazilian collective health journals allow the author to
choose the language of publication. However, other alternatives
are being introduced, and <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i> has recently innovated in this field, offering
the choice of bilingual (Portuguese-English) publication, thus
reaching the international audience and allowing Brazilian
readers the option of reading the article in their mother tongue,
providing greater access to the national audience. SciELO
(Scientific Electronic Library On-line), the portal which houses
the most important Brazilian scientific journals (including those
of collective health and epidemiology), allows free on-line
access to publications, and is an important means of
dissemination of scientific production in Brazil. Journals
indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed offer a link to SciELO, allowing access
to the full-text article.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impact of these choices on the internationalization of
these journals is still largely unknown. <i>Revista de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> is still the only Brazilian
collective health journal indexed in ISI/Thomson, and, therefore,
with a measured impact factor. This factor, however, is very low
(0.2 in 2004), and has not shown an increasing trend in recent
years. A likely cause for this is the fact that the majority of
its articles are published in Portuguese. We still do not know
whether the bilingual (Portuguese-English) publication of
articles, begun in 2003, will lead to an increase in the
journal's impact factor. All these efforts are aimed at
strengthening the process of dissemination of scientific
knowledge, allowing free and widespread access to the knowledge
produced. Knowledge is traditionally disseminated from central
countries (producers) to peripheral ones (receptors and users).
We do not know how much an increase in the production of
knowledge in a given country can influence this scenario.
However, there is no doubt as to the increase in the autonomy of
peripheral countries with respect to the solution of their own
problems and challenges.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the impact of scientific production, it is expected
that an article will serve as a reference for subsequent
articles. ISI/Thomson created the impact factor for scientific
journals in order to measure the mean number of citations of
articles published in a given journal during a given period.
ISI/Thomson also retrieves citations for a given article indexed
in its database. Although universally used, the impact factor has
been the target of much criticism.<sup>8</sup> Recently, other
initiatives have been developed in this field. A noteworthy
effort is Google Scholar, which also retrieves citations for a
given article, and which does not have the limitations of
ISI/Thomson. However, this system does not measure the impact of
specific journals. In applied areas such as collective health,
part of the knowledge produced is used by professionals rather
than by other researchers. Other impacts are thus expected from
applied knowledge in addition to bibliographic impact. However,
non-bibliographic impact (for instance, professional practice,
technology, patents, regulations, among others) is far from being
measurable through standardized procedures, comparable between
different fields of study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The distribution of article production according to subject
also allowed us to gauge the increase in the diversification of
topics addressed by Brazilian epidemiologists. Almeida-Filho et
al<sup>2</sup> reported an increase in publications addressing
inequities in health. This certainly mean to broadening our
knowledge of the complex health problems affecting the Brazilian
population, a necessary step for policies and actions to be
devised and implemented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barreto<sup>5,7</sup> 
  previously argued that the growth of epidemiological knowledge is strongly related 
  to certain characteristics of development in the field, which define the profile 
  of scientific practice among Brazilian epidemiologists. The evidence presented 
  in the present study bring about further elements to show that Brazilian epidemiological 
  research is becoming consolidated at the same pace as other scientific fields 
  in Brazil. This includes its high degree of internationalization, as should 
  be the case with any scientific field. Nevertheless, epidemiology is undergoing 
  such a process without losing contact with its commitments as a social practice, 
  intended to increase our basis of knowledge of the health conditions of the 
  Brazilian population and its determinants and devise possible changes.<sup>4,6</sup> 
  The strengthening of postgraduate programs in collective health and epidemiology 
  in Brazil is due, among other factors, to an increase in the financial resources 
  allocated by the Ministry of Health to epidemiological studies in recent years. 
  An example of this is the approval of large-scale projects such as the ELSA 
  <i>&#150; Estudo Longitudinal de Sa&uacute;de do Adulto</i> (Longitudinal Study 
  of Adult Health). It is expected that, in following decades, the development 
  of new instruments for the evaluation of applied scientific fields, as is the 
  case of epidemiology, may take evaluation beyond the limits of bibliometric 
  quantification. Its effects on health-related policies and actions and on professional 
  practice must be the subject of more thorough evaluations providing a better 
  picture of another of science's characteristics, namely its ability to modify 
  the context into which it is inserted.</font></p>
