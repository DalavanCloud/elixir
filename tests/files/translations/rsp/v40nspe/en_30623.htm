<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Communication flow of scientific information has been
restructured with the development of new technologies and the
Internet and their impact on social relations worldwide. The
production of scientific knowledge has also been influenced by
these cultural, social and economic changes and has contributed
to new patterns of scientific communication. The objective of the
study was to present the traditional scientific communication
model and its evolution to electronic scientific communication
stimulated by the use of electronic media and Internet and
networking. While the traditional model is based on printed
publications, the new one focuses on electronic publishing and
open unlimited access to published literature. The challenges
faced are in using all the potential of electronic media for
improving traditional communication flow of scientific
information and defining policies to support the new model of
scientific communication to ensure quality, preservation and
dissemination of information as a common good.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scientific communication flow comprises formal publication of
research findings, information retrieval, access to published
literature as well as informal communication and information
exchange between researchers. It is a continuous flow as
knowledge published and assimilated generates new knowledge,
research and publications, ruled by a particular dynamics and
influenced by social relations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pellegrini Filho<sup>10</sup> (2000) divides scientific
activity into three basic processes: knowledge production
(research), circulation and incorporation. The author emphasizes
these processes "are immersed in a social totality influenced by
them; on the other hand, these processes are also mostly
influenced through mediating instances such as financing, human
resources training, legitimation, law and regulations,
information dissemination and communication channels, health
system structure, etc."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the advent of the Internet and the development of new
technologies, social relations have changed and scientific
communication flow has been restructured. Castells<sup>2</sup>
says the Internet and the web have brought about social changes
creating a society in which information can be produced and
stored in different spaces and accessed by users from a distance,
facilitating research development and work through collaboration
networks. The globalization process in the twentieth-first
century has gained momentum when people realized the capacity for
collaboration through worldwide networks by making the most of
the technology resources available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Targino<sup>11</sup> (2003) stresses that "technological
applications in the communication process have always led to new
social relations and cultural practices, starting with the
emergence of writing, then the establishment of literature and
press, which enabled wide information dissemination". Changes
brought about by the Internet should be regarded as resulting
from a joint transformation process of subjects and objects.
Changes were introduced between knowledge producers and users.
The development of communication networks through the Internet
and electronic mail has allowed increased social involvement in
political decision processes, participatory management in
companies and institutions, collaboration groups, among
others.<sup>3</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information has transformed the dynamics of collective
knowledge construction by converging communication, decision,
demand, response and action on a common space. Equitable access
to scientific knowledge has become a priority in the definition
of social, economic, and cultural development policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Traditional scientific communication flow, relying on
successive interdependent steps with extended time gaps between
each instance, has moved to the virtual space where there are no
time and physical restrictions. The dynamics of information
diffusion and publication in Internet makes it possible for
actions to follow concurrently and no longer at regular
intervals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Electronic publishing, one of the major expressions of the
impact of the Internet and new technologies on scientific
communication, is often associated to scientific journals but
extends to other forms of formal communication such as books,
official publications, theses, as well as informal scientific
communication such as presentations delivered at meetings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many initiatives 
  of using new technologies for scientific knowledge dissemination has been developed 
  in the health field. In Latin America, the Virtual Health Library (VHL)<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  initiative has contributed to restructuring the scientific information and communication 
  flow . VHL's purpose is to promote convergence of different actors on a common 
  virtual space of public domain. The use of new methodologies and information 
  technologies in VHL has allowed to expand and strengthen a collective space 
  where decentralized and interactive forms of information organization and treatment 
  are applied. VHL "also widens the characteristics of the networks of flows and 
  sources of information, now including domains of implicit, factual, technical 
  and scientific information and knowledge." (Packer, <sup>9</sup> 2005).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study describes and discusses the evolution of the
traditional communication flow of scientific information and its
transformation by the use of electronic media and the
Internet.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>TRADITIONAL 
  COMMUNICATION FLOW OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The traditional communication flow of scientific information
mirrors the printed publishing model and can be schematically
divided into five stages: writing, review, publication, indexing
and dissemination. These stages can be subdivided into
intermediate instances that may follow different
classifications.<sup>1,9</sup> In the traditional flow, stages
are sequential, time- and space-dependent and involve different
actors who are not interconnected. The results of each stage are
communicated through printed documents that are physically
transported from one instance to the next one.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the first stage of the scientific communication flow,
authors write their articles based on their research work or
theoretical thinking. After being written, articles are submitted
to a publisher or scientific journal for publication. In the next
stage, known as peer review, other members of the scientific
community, experts on the subject studied by the author, make
comments and validate the articles submitted for publication.
Peer review is a slow process of reviewing printed manuscripts
sent through conventional means like postal services. Articles
submitted for the approval of the editorial board of a journal or
publisher can be sent back to the author as many times as needed
before its approval. Manuscripts are then reviewed for the
consistency of scientific language and publishing standards. The
whole process can be expected to take months or years before the
article is published and involves many members of the scientific
community.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Approved articles then advance to the next publishing stage of
word and image processing by publishing specialists. After being
published, documents are distributed or purchased by users and
organizations and/or processed and registered into databases of
intermediate institutions in the scientific communication flow,
such as libraries and information centers. Access to these
databases is limited and often requires formal requests made to
libraries or those database producers. Similarly, the process of
obtaining any retrieved publications requires them to be
physically available in library collections, not always close or
accessible to users.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information is disseminated through printed copies or database
search services. Remote database access has started in 1970s
through remote terminals connected by teleprocessing systems.
Selective information dissemination services, based on
bibliographies and databases, were also created at that time.
Information in printed or electronic format was provided for
increasing the visibility of scientific publications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The organization of the traditional scientific communication
flow has numerous limitations, which restrict access to published
documents. The main limitations are: time elapsed from
manuscripts preparation, approval, editing, printing and
distribution, ranging from months to years depending on the flow
management in scientific journals; difficult access and
distribution costs of printed journals that are basically limited
to library collections not always accessible and to all public;
high subscription fees charged by private publishers or
distributors, and even by scientific societies; and continuous
need for increasing spaces for filing printed collections. Such
limitations affect all countries but especially developing
countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To overcome these 
  limitations, from the first decades of the twentieth century, propositions have 
  been put forward to end up publishing journals in issues and privilege publishing 
  them as reprints. In health, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) created 
  the Information Exchange Group to promote direct contact between researchers 
  and exchange of reprints of articles not published by the formal scientific 
  communication system. Despite positive results, this initiative was terminated 
  a couple of years later due to pressure from the publishing industry.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  This initiative is regarded as the precursor of open repositories implemented 
  only after the advent of the Internet.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ELECTRONIC SCIENTIFIC 
  COMMUNICATION FLOW</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Available in the last decades of the twentieth century, the
Internet has changed not only the dynamics of scientific
communication flow but also how science is conducted, by
integrating the scientific community with other social segments
and working through heterogeneous transdisciplinary collaboration
networks linking a variety of organizations. These collaboration
networks have evolved facilitated by advances in communication
media and the Internet. The process of scientific knowledge
production became non-linear involving all actors, from research
conception to result application, and carrying implications to
both writing and validation stages. The validation stage,
formerly limited to the scientific community, has opened up to
the community at large that can assess result reliability and
social implications of research advancements.<sup>4,7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, the evolution of scientific communication flow in
the electronic era goes beyond electronic publishing of
documents, also encompassing behavior changes of the scientific
community and its relations with society. "Besides the innovative
approach of the Internet as a publishing technology, a political
perspective was brought about advocating scientific knowledge as
a common good, critical to social and economic development."
(Packer,<sup>9</sup> 2005).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Linearity and sequentiality, intrinsic to the traditional
model, have been replaced by an agile, fast, dynamic, and
sometimes interactive communication flow in the virtual space
created by the Internet. The new flow makes it possible the
convergence of authors, reviewers and editors (information
producers), libraries and information centers (intermediate
instances) and users (readers and researchers) and promotes idea
and experience sharing. Communication is established through
messages and digital files automatically transferred from one
stage to the next one that can be visible and accessible to many
actors at the same time regardless of their physical
distances.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to opening up new possibilities of interaction,
electronic publishing has added a new stage in the communication
flow of scientific information: the generation of measures and
evaluation indicators. Evaluation is pervasive in all stages:
authors can track the indicators of the approval flow of their
articles; editors and reviewers can track the flow of peer review
and manage deadlines efficiently; and researchers, editors and
managers can track the number of accesses, comments and received
citations ..</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Networking and electronic publishing allow actors to exchange
roles in the many stages of the scientific communication flow:
authors can play the role of publishers when they publish their
articles in their own websites or in open or institutional
repositories with no need of intermediaries; editors become
database producers by providing access, in their journal's
websites, to specific fields of data (author, subject, date and
others) from the whole collection; database producers become
information providers by ensuring access to full texts and, at
the same time, promoting links among databases to increase
visibility of scientific production. "The digital revolution is
is offering alternatives both to how the various stages of these
processes are conducted and who does them." as stated in a report
of The US National Academies symposium.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Electronic publishing of scientific journals makes articles
available ahead of print, right after being approved by editors.
This publishing approach promotes increasing visibility of
research results and reduced time between article approval and
its publication in printed format. The scientific article becomes
an independent information unit, though these units will be
subsequently arranged in issues, when ruled by traditional
principles. Additional information and versions in different
languages can be included in journal's websites, adding value to
the printed format. Printed copies and issue arrangement in the
new communication flow of scientific information are thus
byproducts of the material electronically published.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scientific communication flow has also been favored by the
possibility of creating interactive spaces for scientists like
discussion forums and virtual communities to be used from the
early stages of a research project up to research writing. Many
editors have offered opportunity for article discussion by the
scientific community in their journals' websites. Comments added
at the end of every article contribute to science development and
represent a new approach to result validation.
Mueller<sup>5</sup> (1994) underlines recognition and opinions of
other scientists are major promoters for authors to publish their
scientific work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Open Access 
  movement, starting in 2001, has ensured open publishing of electronic documents 
  with copyrights reserved as long as sources are cited. In this regard, open 
  access journal repositories and institutional and thematic collections have 
  been strengthened. According to The National Academies report,<sup>6</sup> editors 
  have allowed articles published in their journals to be automatically filed 
  in their repositories in the format of the final approved manuscript, right 
  after or after a couple of months they are published, according to journals' 
  access policies. Following this trend, in May 2005, the U.S. Department of Health 
  and Human Services NIH<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> adopted 
  a policy establishing all authors who were granted full or partial NIH financing 
  and have published their research findings in scientific journals should file 
  a copy of the approved manuscript in their digital library, the PubMed Central.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Internet has 
  turned access to information democratic making it possible for countries to 
  adopt similar methodologies and technologies regardless of their level of development. 
  Developing countries have been and will be mostly favored by electronic publishing, 
  which has enabled them to overcome obstacles of visibility and access to their 
  publications, virtually inaccessible to the international community in the past. 
  BIREME (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information) 
  has introduced open access initiatives in the VHL such as SciELO (Scientific 
  Electronic Library Online).<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
  A seminar held in September 2005 culminated in approving the <i>Salvador's Declaration 
  on Open Access: the developing world perspective,</i><a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
  which urges governments to make Open Access a high priority in science policies, 
  including strengthening open access publications, repositories and other related 
  initiatives and promoting integration of developing countries scientific information 
  in the worldwide body of knowledge.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ELECTRONIC HEALTH 
  JOURNALS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scientific journals are the most visible form of electronic
publication although this same model can be applied to all sorts
of documents. In LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health
Sciences Literature) database, 30% of all documents published in
the last 10 years are available in the Internet, of which 98% are
journal articles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first electronic 
  scientific journal was the Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials, published 
  in 1992 by OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) in Ohio, US, with full texts 
  and charts. In March 2006, DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals),<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a> 
  coordinated by Lund University Libraries in Sweden, covered 2,160 open access 
  electronic journals, of which 595 are searchable at article level. DOAJ covers 
  312 health journals, of which 77 are public health journals. Ibero and Latin 
  American journals of SciELO collections are included in DOAJ.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SciELO was the 
  first initiative of open access in developing countries. It was introduced in 
  1997, in Brazil, with the publication of ten different titles; four of them 
  being health journals. In May 2006, SciELO Brazil included 160 titles, 83 (52%) 
  were health sciences and indexed in LILACS database.<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a> 
  The whole SciELO collections comprising Latin American and Caribbean countries, 
  Spain and Portugal cover 167 health journals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VHL Portal of Scientific Journals includes around 8,600
current health journals, 50% available electronically. Of 5,236
journals indexed in MEDLINE database and included in VHL Portal,
3,457 (66%) are electronic journals in open or restricted access
mode. The proportion of electronically journals published in
Latin American and Caribbean countries indexed in LILACS database
grew from 18% in 2001 to 78% in 2006.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increased visibility 
  of public health journals electronically available can be evidenced by SciELO 
  access and citation indicators. The most accessed journals in SciELO Brazil 
  are <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> (Journal of Public Health) 
  and <i>Cadernos de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> (Reports in Public Health), 
  accounting for 9% of total accesses to SciELO. In SciELO's Public Health collection, 
  Brazilian journals are not only the most accessed but also the most cited. This 
  specialized collection,<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a> 
  launched in 1999, contains the eight most representative titles in public health, 
  published in six countries and indexed in international databases. Accesses 
  to journals in this collection exceeded two million per month in 2006.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CHALLENGES AND 
  PERSPECTIVES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Changes in the scientific communication flow after the advent
of the Internet reflect an ongoing profound re-thinking of
cultural, social and economic values. Besides requiring actors to
constantly adjust to new technologies, these changes call for
breaking resistance to the transience and reliability of
electronic versions and to current academic communication
standards. Oliveira &amp; Noronha<sup>8</sup> (2005) assert that
"for digital communication to be fully accepted by the scientific
community unsettled issues should be discussed and defined such
as authorship and copyrights guarantees, information permanence
and validity, and publishers' access policies".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Electronic publishing 
  has been acknowledged as a solution for outdated methodology and technology 
  in scientific communication flow with the potential of breaking with the standards 
  of printed scientific journals, available for almost 400 years, or even eliminating 
  them. However, while there are currently numerous electronic journals, electronic 
  publishing is still replicating or enhancing the established standards. In 1968, 
  Lemos<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a> anticipated that 
  in the future journals would be replaced with other media, like image and audio 
  recordings of researchers' reports, but such boldness and creativity is still 
  experimental in scientific journals. Few journals are fully electronic or explore 
  the potential of electronic publishing by promoting the use of dynamic imaging, 
  sound and other multimedia resources in addition to links between text and cited 
  sources. The electronic text could be dynamic allowing users to follow the same 
  paths followed by authors while preparing their manuscripts or developing their 
  research projects with unlimited connections between electronic documents and 
  web sites. Text citation could be replaced by access to full texts of the original 
  document; procedure descriptions could be replaced by dynamic imaging or videos; 
  interviews and discussions could be replaced by their audio and video recording. 
  Though electronic publishing should not replicate printed publishing, it is 
  still so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Challenges are posed for the use of the whole potential of
electronic media by enhancing the positive aspects and quality of
traditional standards of scientific communication flow and
defining policies that would be supportive of the new system and
would ensure information preservation and distribution as a
common good.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During this transient period standards have been preserved,
sometimes apparently contradictory, and some issues remain
unanswered. Various journals publish articles online immediately
after their approval but others publish them online long after
printed publications are available. Printed publishing has
effectively become a byproduct of electronic publishing and it
seems to be maintained only to respond to traditional flow
standards or preserve contents in a different format. It can be
argued that printed publishing needs to be maintained as access
to the Internet is the privilege of some and printed publications
can reach out communities that still are not integrated to the
worldwide network. On the other hand, distribution of printed
scientific journals does not either assure its access in all
communities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The journal Science<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a> 
  has innovated by publishing printed, electronic and digital formats. The difference 
  between the electronic and digital format is that the latter is a carbon copy 
  of the printed format including sections not available electronically. Subscribers 
  have access to the digital journal at a lower cost and can print it or store 
  it in their computers. The purpose is to allow subscribers to save full collections 
  in their computers and access to advertising material that financially support 
  the journal, at the same time preserving the traditional values of scientific 
  communication.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Electronic publishing has brought about endless perspectives
for promoting changes in scientific communication culture. Open
access through the Internet helps advance democratization and
equitable access to scientific information. Opening up spaces for
interaction and convergence of authors, editors and users can
contribute to the inclusion of new actors in the scientific
communication and information flow and encourage scientific
research findings to be widely available.</font></p>
