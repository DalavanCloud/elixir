<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To estimate the proportion of occupational accident benefits granted within 
  the total for health-related social security benefits, viewing the costs according 
  to benefit type and the impact on productivity according to work days lost.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> Records of benefit decisions from the National Benefits System 
  of the National Social Security Institute for the State of Bahia in 2000 were 
  utilized. Occupational accidents were defined in accordance with the clinical 
  diagnoses of External Causes, Injuries and Poisoning (SS-00 to T99) of the International 
  Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> Revision, and with the benefit type, 
  which distinguishes between occupational and non-occupational health problems.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> A total of 31,096 benefits granted due to illnesses or health 
  problems were studied. Of these, 2,857 (7.3%) were caused by work accidents. 
  Greater proportions were found among workers in the manufacturing, construction, 
  electricity and gas industries, accounting for 18% of the total benefits. The 
  costs of occupational accident benefits were estimated to be R$8.5 million, 
  with around half a million work days lost during the year studied.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Despite the fact that these data are under-reported and 
  are restricted to workers who were able to receive health-related benefits, 
  the findings reveal that avoidable health problems have a major impact on productivity 
  and on the budget of the National Social Security Institute, thereby reinforcing 
  the need for their prevention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Occupational accidents are avoidable and cause a great impact
on productivity and on the economy, as well as great suffering.
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), about
270 million work-related accidents and about two million deaths
occur around the world every year.<sup>7</sup> Because they are
potentially avoidable, their occurrence is an expression of
negligence and social injustice.<sup>4</sup> The costs of
work-related accidents are rarely taken into account, even in
countries that have made significant advances within the field of
prevention.<sup>4</sup> It has been estimated that 4% of the
gross domestic product (GDP) is lost because of occupational
diseases and health conditions, and this can go up to 10% in
developing countries.<sup>7</sup> In Brazil, based on the GDP for
the year 2002, these estimated losses would be between
US$21,899,480 and US$54,748,700. These figures reflect the low
effectiveness of polices and programs for preventing work-related
health problems. However, these estimates are limited to economic
costs and do not include the emotional impact and the impact on
families, which are difficult to quantify. There have been
increasing numbers of studies making scientific estimates of
occupational accident costs over the last few years. This has
resulted from development of the field of health economics and
the close relationship between work and economics, either because
of the risk factors for accidents, or because of their effects on
productity.<sup>5,6,9,10,13,14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the United States, Leigh et al<sup>8</sup> (1997) estimated
a total cost of US$145.37 billion for fatal and non-fatal
occupational accidents in 1992. The direct costs from medical
expenses such as treatment and rehabilitation, and some
non-medical expenses such as transportation represented 34% of
the total. The indirect costs represented by productivity and
production losses, indemnities and salary compensations, among
others, were estimated as US$96.2 billion. Also according to this
study, the total cost of diseases and work-related accidents was
higher than those related to AIDS or Alzheimer's disease, and
comparable to cancer-related costs. Other studies have also
revealed the high costs of work-related accidents in countries
such as China,<sup>14</sup> and Lebanon,<sup>6</sup> although it
is difficult to compare the results because of differences in
procedures and the specific characteristics of each country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, a substantial proportion of the direct costs from
work-related accidents is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Social Security. Through the National Institute for Social
Security (INSS), the ministry has the mission of ensuring the
right to social security. This is defined as social insurance
that has the aim of recognizing and granting rights to insured
individuals, whose contributions are used for funding the
expenses relating to various benefits. Among these are
compensation for income loss when workers are unable to work
because of disease, disability, advanced age, death, involuntary
unemployment, maternity, or detainment. The INSS is responsible
for collecting the contributions and funding the expenses
relating to the payment of benefits within the National Benefits
System (SUB). Within the context of social security, the term
<i>work-related accidents</i> refers to injuries resulting from
external causes, traumas and poisoning that have occurred in the
working environment while performing occupational activities
and/or on the journey to or from work, and also occupational
diseases. The resulting benefits are named "accident benefits".
However, in the present study, the definition of work-related
accidents has been restricted to traumas due to external causes,
injuries and poisoning, as commonly used in epidemiological
studies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are few Brazilian 
  studies on the costs of work-related accidents or their impact on productivity. 
  In 1982, De Cicco<sup>3</sup> (1984) conducted a pioneering survey on this topic, 
  among all companies in Brazil with 500 or more workers registered. This study 
  estimated the insured and non-insured costs corresponding to the first 15 days 
  off work, which are borne by employers. Among the 263 companies analyzed, the 
  insured cost was calculated as 7,354,068 Adjustable Obligations of the National 
  Treasury (ORTN), the monetary reference at that time, and the total cost corresponded 
  to 27,962 ORTN. The highest insured costs were found among companies in the 
  transportation sector, followed by the paper and cardboard industry and communication 
  and broadcasting companies. For other insured costs, the highest were the chemical 
  and pharmaceutical industry, textile companies and communication and broadcasting 
  companies. The companies with greatest total costs from occupational accidents 
  were those in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, transportation sector, 
  and communications and broadcasting. Subsequently, Costa<sup>2</sup> (1993) 
  analyzed the cost of work accidents to the INSS, using maintenance benefit data. 
  Among 435,643 benefits analyzed, the estimate cost for urban areas was R$87,834,269.45 
  (U$41,044,051.15), while the cost for rural areas was R$1,165,956.87 (U$54,483,965.89) 
  (amounts corrected to 2005 values). Some data on social security costs are published 
  regularly in the Social Security Yearbook,<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  but without analyses relating to activity groups, among other possible specifications. 
  These data, although partial, need to be regularly estimated and published because 
  of their economic importance and their relevance for the health system, in order 
  to make entrepreneurs, managers and health professionals more sensitive towards 
  this public health problem that is still neglected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of the present study was to estimate the
contribution of benefits granted due to occupational accidents,
within the total for health-related benefits, focusing on costs
according to benefit type and the impact on productivity as
measured by lost workdays.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was carried out using records of authorizations for
social security benefit payments from the National Benefits
System of the INSS, for the State of Bahia, in the year 2000. The
data correspond to all workers who held formal employment
contracts, under the General System for Social Security (RGPS).
These contractual ties are recorded in the National Register of
Social Information (CNIS), by companies and workers, and are
updated every month using data from the Guarantee Fund for Length
of Service (FGTS) and other information from the INSS.
Public-sector employees , self-employed workers and domestic
employees were all excluded, because they are not eligible for
the benefits under analysis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Benefits 
  System is a data registration system belonging to the INSS. The data are processed 
  by DATAPREV, in which each social security event or occurrence that originates 
  the granting of a benefit is registered. SUB allows retrieval of data on companies 
  and employees, such as the coded clinical diagnosis based on the International 
  Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-10); field of economic 
  activity as coded in the National Classification of Economic Activities (CNAE) 
  that is used in Brazil; the number of the Work Accident Communication (CAT); 
  start and finish date for each benefit; amount of the monthly payment; and the 
  type of benefit. The latter is coded according to the nature of the health problem: 
  whether it is occupational or not; severity of sequelae or injury; and the corresponding 
  type of benefit (whether it is a case of retirement because of permanent disability 
  or temporary medical leave, among others). In this study, only compensation 
  claims authorized, i.e. granted, between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2000, 
  were considered. Payment authorizations correspond to approvals of claims. Such 
  claims are only filed 15 days after the accident, when the expenses of salary 
  compensation become a responsibility of the INSS. To estimate the costs, benefits 
  relating to all occupational accidents or diseases were considered; and for 
  lost workdays, only the benefits corresponding initially to temporary absence 
  from work were taken into account. The <a href="#fig">Figure</a> presents a 
  diagram of all the possible outcomes from a work-related accident and the respective 
  types of social security benefits.</font></p>
<p><a name="fig"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e07f1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Benefits are generated following general medical referrals, or
through issuing a CAT for occupational accidents or diseases (B91
to B93). In this latter case, the company needs to issue the CAT
no later than the first working day following the accident. A
copy is handed to the worker, to document the benefit claim
request. However, the majority of cases are not characterized by
an occupational diagnosis, i.e. by a so-called "causal
connection". These cases do not have a CAT form for claiming the
accident benefit from the INSS. Nevertheless, many cases are
identified as occupational accidents or diseases by expert
examiners, from consultations that are apparently not
occupational in the origin. Thus, many benefits in the B91 to B93
series do not have CAT data, and for these, an occupational
linkage for the disease or health problem was identified within
the social security attendance system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The variable "work-related accidents" (1=yes, 0=other
diagnoses) was defined on the basis of clinical diagnoses in
ICD-10, and corresponded to cases of trauma due to external
causes, injuries and poisoning (Chapter XIX), codes SS00 to T99,
and the benefit granted corresponded to health problems of
occupational nature from Series 90. The remaining cases were
classified as other diagnoses. All B93 benefits, i.e. pensions
granted to relatives of people who died from occupational
accidents and diseases were considered as work-related accidents
due to external causes. The other variables used were the type of
benefit (B91 to B94), number of days off work, including the 15
days without benefit payment, the amount of the payment in reais,
and the CNAE type, grouped into nine categories: agriculture,
fishing and extractive industries; manufacturing or processing
industry; civil construction, electricity and gas; transportation
and communications; financial intermediation (banks, finance
companies and insurance companies); education, leisure, cultural
and sports activities; social and health services; and a category
for information not declared.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The monthly cost of the benefit was calculated as the product
between the duration in days and the daily amount paid, which
were estimated from the duration and the annual amounts available
in the database. Because of strong asymmetry, aberrant values in
the distribution of these variables, and the need to use means,
the values above the first percentile (1%) were replaced by the
value corresponding to this cutoff point. Missing values were
taken as the geometric mean corresponding to the distribution
after normalization via logarithmic transformation. For ongoing
benefit claims relating to pensions, the last day of the study
reference year (December 31, 2000) was taken, even though many of
them may have extended beyond this date. Cost analysis was
carried out by estimating the distribution of the geometric means
and standard deviations of the monthly cost and the total cost of
the benefit, in reais, according to CNAE type and benefit
type.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The number of lost workdays was also analyzed by means of the
geometric mean and standard deviation, including the 15 days
preceding the start of benefit payment. Because of the nature of
pensions for relatives of people who died from work-related
accidents (B93), these were excluded. Comparisons were made
according to CNAE type, using mean and proportion ratios, when
applicable. Statistical tests were not used, since the total
number of benefits was considered. The analysis was carried out
using the SAS 8.11 software. The identities of workers and
companies were not recorded in the database and, since these were
administrative data, the study protocol was not submitted to the
Internal Review Board.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A total of 257,645 benefits granted by the INSS for workers
covered by social security living in the State of Bahia in 2000
were identified. Of these, 39,883 (15.5%) corresponded to
health-related benefits. From the latter, 822 (2.1%) were
excluded because the clinical diagnosis was missing, leaving
39,061 records for the study analysis. Out of this total for
health-related benefits, 11.7% related to occupational health
problems, while occupational accidents (external causes, injuries
and poisoning) represented 7.3%. Among all the occupational
benefits, accidents represented 62.8%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the benefits 
  for health problems, the proportion of work accidents ranged from 4.3% for workers 
  without CNAE registration to 18.0% for the manufacturing industry and for construction/electricity/gas 
  companies. These figures were more than twice what was expected (proportion 
  ratio, PR=2.47) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e07t1.gif">Table 1</a>). Extractive activities 
  from the primary production sector and commercial activities represented 13.5% 
  and 13.0% of work-related accidents, respectively. These were 78% higher than 
  the overall estimate. The largest contributions of work-related accidents in 
  relation to occupational benefits were in the commerce/accommodation/food sector 
  (77.4%) and construction/electricity/gas (75.3%). In the sector of financial 
  intermediation and similar economic activities, the proportion of occupational 
  accidents (39.3%) was 37% lower than what was expected (PR=0.63).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The distribution 
  of benefits granted for work-related accidents according to benefit type and 
  CNAE groups is presented in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e07t2.gif">Table 2</a>. Around 33.9% 
  of these benefits did not present CNAE data, and the proportion ranged from 
  28.9% for temporary disability assistance to 74% for pensions granted in relation 
  to fatal accidents. As expected, 81.7% of the benefits related to temporary 
  disability, followed by cases of permanent disability (9.6%). Workers in the 
  latter category were granted retirement due to disability. Situations that led 
  to death represented 5.1% of the total for accident-related benefits, while 
  indemnities in cases of sequelae corresponded to 3.6%. With regard to the proportions 
  of benefits granted for work accidents according to CNAE group, the highest 
  estimates were concentrated in the construction/electricity/gas group: 13.2% 
  for B91, 11.0% for B92 and 18.4% for B94; followed by the commerce/accommodation/food 
  sector (15.5%, 5.5% and 15.6%, respectively), and the manufacturing industry 
  (17.4%, 7.0% and 5.4%, in the same order).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean monthly 
  cost to the Social Security System from occupational accidents was R$294.00 
  (US$137.38). According to the type of benefit, the highest monthly means were 
  estimated for pensions related to deaths (R$430.00/ US$200.93) and permanent 
  disability retirement (R$425.00/ US$198.60). The compensation for accidents 
  had a mean value of R$198.00 (US$92.52), and the lowest value was R$141.00 (US$65.89) 
  for the health/social services sector. The highest estimate corresponded to 
  pensions due to disability in the group of transportation/post office/telecommunications 
  and similar companies (R$934.00/ US$436.45), and this was close to the figure 
  for the education/leisure/culture sector (R$802.00/ US$374.77) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e07t3.gif">Table 
  3</a>). <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e07t4.gif">Table 4</a> shows the total cost of the benefits 
  granted for occupational accidents in Bahia in 2000, which was approximately 
  R$8,492,762.00 (US$3,968,580.37). Salary compensations due to temporary time 
  off work represented 71.4% of these costs, payment of retirement pensions for 
  permanent disability represented 15%, pensions for worker's relatives in cases 
  of death represented 10.6%, and accident indemnities represented 3.0% (B94). 
  With regard to expenses relating to all benefit types and CNAE groups, 32% of 
  them came from benefits without registration of the economic activity group, 
  and these corresponded to R$2,679,478.00 (US$1,252,092). When the analysis was 
  limited to B94, the proportion of expenses on benefits without CNAE data increased 
  to 63.0%. On the other hand, among benefits for which the CNAE type was stated, 
  the highest relative contributions to the expenses were from B91, B92 and B93, 
  for the construction/electricity/gas sector (15%, 13%, and 19%, respectively), 
  thus totaling R$1,269,770.00 (US$593,370.00) for the year. Similar values were 
  obtained for the manufacturing industry, except for death-related benefits. 
  For the B94 code, also in relation to fatal accidents, the highest relative 
  costs occurred in the manufacturing industry (8%), but most of the claims did 
  not present CNAE data.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 2,333 benefits 
  granted for temporary disability corresponded to 509,062 lost workdays and had 
  a mean duration of 113 days (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e07t5.gif">Table 5</a>). Benefits 
  without CNAE data represented 33% of the total, corresponding to 167,782 lost 
  workdays in one year. Benefits with CNAE data showed higher proportions of lost 
  workdays in the commerce/accommodation/food sector (15%), manufacturing industry 
  (14.5%) and construction/electricity/gas sector (13.3%). The mean number of 
  lost workdays ranged from 76 (health/social services) to 115 (financial intermediation 
  and the like), which corresponded to 10,427, and 44,566 lost days/year, respectively. 
  The industrial sectors in which work accidents had the greatest impact on productivity 
  were, in this order, commerce/accommodation/food (76,338 days, 15.0%), manufacturing 
  industry (74,012, 14.5%), and construction/electricity/gas (67,607, 13.3%). 
  Together, these totaled 217,957 days, representing 42.8% of the lost workdays 
  caused by work-related accidents in one year.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results show the great burden represented by work
accidents, among the diseases and health problems that generate
temporary disability for work, among workers who could receive
social security benefits in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the large number of observations analyzed, the results
from the present study should be considered with caution. Even
when eligible, the majority of workers involved in accidents do
not receive or seek benefits from the INSS. Several studies from
different regions of Brazil have shown that the underreporting of
fatal accidents is greater than 70%<sup>12</sup> and for
non-fatal accidents it is over 90%.<sup>11</sup> In addition, the
poor quality of social security data has been showed here, with
one third of the observations presenting no CNAE data. In a study
based on this same database, it was found that 62% of accident
benefits did not have CAT data.<sup>12</sup> This indicates that
the burden of work-related accidents in relation to the total
number of health-related benefits granted could be much higher
than what is reported in the present study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other important limitations on the analysis were the lack of
information on age and gender, the missing data from CAT records
on accident characteristics, and the lack of a beneficiary
identification number, which limited the checking of possible
repeated cases. It should be noted that the data analyzed only
reflect the most serious cases, i.e., those in which there were
15 or more days off work. Cases of shorter disability duration
are not translated into costs for the social security system, but
they have an impact on productivity and other costs for companies
and employees. With regard to costs, only the expenses on benefit
payments limited to a one-year period and to accidents with
temporary leave from work were considered. Medical and
administrative costs and those directly borne by companies and by
the workers themselves and their relatives were excluded.
Therefore, this is only an estimate of a small fraction of the
total economic costs of work-related accidents, and does not take
into consideration the costs that are unmeasurable or intangible
because of their own nature.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although data comparisons are compromised because of the
differences in social security systems around the world, a study
carried out in the United States<sup>5</sup> found that permanent
disabilities represented 5 to 10% of the benefits total, which is
close to the estimate of 9.6% in the present study. No studies on
social security data were found regarding the proportion of
death-related benefits caused by work accidents, which would be
an indicator of severity and lethality. However, lethality has
been increasing in Brazil over the last few years.<sup>12</sup>
Also in the United States, Boden &amp; Galizzi<sup>1</sup> (1999)
analyzed compensation claims paid as a result of work-related
accidents with one or more weeks off work and estimated that 78%
were related to total temporary disability, while 18%
corresponded to partial disability. These results are similar to
those in the present study, in which the benefits proportion was
around 80%. However, this comparison is impaired because the
benefits relating to death or total permanent disability were not
taken into account in the American study. On the other hand, only
4% of the records were incomplete or unusable in the
analysis.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean cost per 
  month of benefits paid by the INSS due to work accidents in Bahia in 2000 reflects 
  the profile of insured workers' salaries (IBGE, 2006).<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>**</sup></a> 
  Industrial sectors with greater mean costs did not coincide with those with 
  higher relative frequencies of cases of work accidents, which has a differential 
  impact on total costs. The most important fact to consider, however, is the 
  impact of these costs on the INSS, as shown by the total estimated cost of benefit 
  payments due to work accidents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impact of work-related accidents on productivity and
economic production was also large, as revealed by the number of
lost workdays, in spite of the underreporting of these data.
Excluding cases of retirement due to permanent disability and
only taking into consideration formally registered workers (less
than 50% of the total), there were more than half million lost
workdays in the State of Bahia in 2000. The sectors with the
greatest duration of time off work were financial intermediation,
construction/electricity/gas, transportation/communications, and
agriculture/fishing and the like. However, when the number of
cases and total lost workdays were analyzed by sector, those with
the largest economic losses through lost productivity due to work
accidents were commerce/accommodation/food, manufacturing
industry and construction/electricity/gas, all with figures very
close to each other.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Work accident prevention programs are justified because of the
loss of life, physical disability and great suffering imposed on
people. These problems are common in Brazil, although largely
avoidable.<sup>12</sup> Their occurrence indicate social
injustice and should deserve priority in workers' health
protection policies. Together, the findings from the present
study indicate one facet, albeit partial of the relative
dimension of work injuries among health-related benefits. They
also indicate part, and possible only a small part, of the total
cost to society, as expressed by the amount paid as benefits by
the INSS, and by the number of lost workdays. What can be seen is
that the sectors of commerce/accommodation/food, manufacturing
and construction/electricity/gas should deserve special
prevention programs. The transportation sector was not ranked as
highly as expected, considering the increasing numbers of traffic
accidents and the poor condition of the country's road network,
but this may reflect underreporting among these workers. The
small number of cases coming from agricultural, livestock-rearing
and extractive activities can also be highlighted. These
activities are recognized as presenting high risk, which can be
explained by the great informality of job contracts in this
sector, or by the incipient degree of awareness of rural workers
about their rights relating to social security. It is worth
highlighting the large concentration of pensions due to deaths in
the construction/electricity/gas and commercial sectors, which
were much higher than the figures estimated for other CNAE
groups.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the light of the absence of diagnosis data from outpatient
clinics, especially in the National Health System (SUS), and the
underreporting of occupational health problems in hospitals and
outpatient clinics, only primary data would be capable of giving
trustworthy estimates. Thus, with a view to estimating the costs
of work accidents, it is suggested that population-based studies
should be conducted using primary data, taking into account the
expenses of social security institutions, and also the medical
costs borne by companies, workers and their families. Despite the
limitations, the present study provides an original contribution
regarding work-related accident costs. It is expected that this
study will be disseminated among worker protection policymakers
and among the managers and directors of companies, who continue
to hold great responsibility regarding workers' safety.</font></p>
