<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To assess the validity of self-reported weight and height at the time of diagnosing 
  obesity, and to identify the sociodemographic and individual characteristics 
  that might be a source of information bias.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> This was a cross-sectional population-based study carried out 
  in the city of Goi&acirc;nia in 2001. Interviews were conducted with 1,023 individuals 
  aged 20-64 years, in their homes, to collect sociodemographic and self-reported 
  weight and height information. On the same occasion, weight and height measurements 
  were made on these individuals. The mean differences and correlation coefficients 
  between self-reported and measured data were calculated according to age, body 
  mass index (BMI), schooling, income and height.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> 
  Both the men and women overestimated their heights (p&lt;0.05), by 0.9 cm and 
  2.2 cm, respectively. There was no difference between self-reported and measured 
  weights, either for the men (-0.44 kg; p=0.06) or for the women (-0.03 kg; p&gt;0.05). 
  The behavior of overestimating height was influenced by age, schooling, height 
  and body mass index. Although this index obtained from the self-reported data 
  was underestimated (p&lt;0.05), by 0.27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.67 kg/m<sup>2</sup> 
  for men and women respectively, the measured and self-reported data presented 
  a high degree of agreement. Both the sensitivity and specificity of the self-reported 
  body mass index were high, in relation to identifying the measured index.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> 
  In epidemiological studies for monitoring the prevalence of excess weight in 
  populations, self-reported weights and heights constitute reliable data, which 
  gives validity to the methodology utilized.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The high prevalence of chronic non-transmittable diseases has
increased the interest in studies in which information on signs
and symptoms and associated risk factors is obtained from
self-reporting by the population. The data can be gathered by
means of face-to-face interviews, by sending out questionnaires
through the post, or by telephone interviews. These procedures
make it possible to assess and follow up representative samples
from the population, over the course of time, at lower cost and
with simplification of the fieldwork.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these studies, among the variables reported are
measurements of weight and height. These are utilized for
calculating the body mass index (BMI), which is the
anthropometric index most utilized in population studies. The
results from various studies<sup>4,7,8,12</sup> have shown that
self-reported weight and height present high concordance with
data obtained directly. These results are therefore an
interesting alternative for measuring and monitoring the
prevalence of obesity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, evidence has shown that the error in the information
is related to characteristics like obesity, age, social
conditions, cultural factors and psychological factors. In the
case of anthropometric measurements, there is a tendency to want
to attain a socially valued appearance for the body. In this
respect, greater underestimation of weight has been observed
among obese individuals and overestimation of height has
particularly been seen among people of short
stature.<sup>3,4,8,13,14</sup> Older individuals also tend to
overestimate their present height to a greater extent than do
younger people, partly because of the gradual loss of height that
takes place with aging.<sup>4,8,12</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the error is not random, high prevalence of individuals
who underestimate or overestimate their weight and/or height
measurements leads to a biased BMI classification, with a
reduction in the prevalence of individuals situated at the
extremes of the classifications (obesity and low weight).
Therefore, before utilizing self-reported weight and height
measurements for a given population, it is pertinent to conduct
studies that enable determination of the magnitude of the error
associated with this information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far, few studies have been conducted in Brazil on the
validity of self-reported weight and height
measurements.<sup>1,2,10,11</sup> In a study conducted on the
urban population of Porto Alegre, Schmidt et al<sup>10</sup>
(1993) observed that weight was overestimated by men and
underestimated by women, but they concluded that the validity of
self-reported weight was acceptable in obesity prevalence
studies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of the present study was to assess the validity
of self-reported weight and height for diagnosing obesity, and to
identify the sociodemographic and individual characteristics that
could contain information bias.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data from a project 
  entitled "Study on the prevalence and knowledge of arterial hypertension and 
  some risk factors in a region of Brazil" were utilized.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  This was a cross-sectional population-based study that was carried out in the 
  state capitals and two other cities of the States of Goi&aacute;s and Mato Grosso, 
  Midwestern Brazil. In the present study, only the data relating to Goi&acirc;nia 
  were analyzed, which were gathered between June and December 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sample size for the municipality of Goi&acirc;nia was
calculated by taking into consideration a population of 1,004,098
inhabitants, 20% prevalence of arterial hypertension in Brazil
among the adult population, confidence interval of 95% and
estimation error of 10%. The sample obtained (n=1,534) was
increased by 30% to cover for losses (N=1,994). The homes were
selected by means of probabilistic sampling by clusters, in two
stages. The first stage consisted of identifying the census
tracts that were utilized in the National Home Sampling Survey
(PNAD) of 1998, in the urban zone of the municipality of
Goi&acirc;nia. The second stage consisted of selecting homes in
each census tract and the total size of the sample. From
calculation of the sample size per census tract, the homes in
each tract were drawn randomly and systematically.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the homes selected, only one person living there was
interviewed, drawn from among the residents aged over 18 years,
in order to avoid problems of interdependence of information
between interviewees. Pregnant women and mothers with children
aged less than six months were excluded from the draw, to avoid
errors of data interpretation. Residents who were hospitalized
were also excluded. Among the losses (N=540), 121 addresses were
not located, or there was no home at that location, while in 419
cases the interview was not conducted because the residents
refused to participate, the home was unoccupied, or there was no
one at home (making a maximum of three visits on different days
and at different times).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sample consisted of 1,454 non-hospitalized individuals
living in the urban area (72.9% of the total sample and 95% of
the sample needed). Of these, 1,252 individuals (433 men and 819
women) aged 20 to 64 years were eligible. Individuals who did not
give information regarding self-reported height (10 men and 113
women), self-reported weight (22 men and 39 women) or either of
these (six men and 39 women) were excluded. Thus, 229 individuals
(18.3%) were excluded: 38 men (8.8%) and 191 women (23.3%). The
final sample was therefore composed of 1,023 individuals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data collection was carried out by trained interviewers,
who filled out a standardized questionnaire containing questions
on sociodemographic conditions and lifestyle (diet, physical
activity, alcohol consumption and smoking) and measurements of
arterial pressure, weight, height and waist circumference. Before
making the anthropometric measurements, the individuals stated
their current weight and height. The anthropometric measurements
were obtained by utilizing the standardized procedures of Lohman,
Roche &amp; Martorel.<sup>5</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The individuals were weighed and measured without shoes on and
wearing light clothing. To measure weights, a Plenna electronic
balance (Giant Lithium model) was utilized, with a capacity of
150 kg and precision of 100 g. To measure heights, a portable
stadiometer (Seca) was utilized, with precision of 0.1 cm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The BMI was calculated 
  by dividing the weight (kg) by the square of the height (m). To classify the 
  BMI values, the recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO,<sup>16</sup> 
  1997) were utilized: &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (underweight); 18.5 to 24.99 
  kg/m<sup>2</sup> (normal weight); 25 to 29.99 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (overweight); 
  and <u>&gt;</u>30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After reviewing the questionnaires, the data were typed in
twice, to assess the typing quality. For this analysis, Stata 7.0
was utilized.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The errors in the information on height, weight and BMI were
obtained as the difference between the self-reported and measured
values. Negative values signified underestimation of the
self-reported values and positive values represented
overestimation of the self-reported values.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paired Student 
  t-test was utilized to assess the differences between the means of the self-reported 
  and measured values, for each sex. Analysis of variance was utilized to evaluate 
  the differences between the self-reported and measured values according to age 
  categories (20-24; 25-34; 35-44; 45-54; and 55-64), schooling (&lt;9 years and 
  <u>&gt;</u>9 years); BMI (&lt;18.5; 18.5-24; 25-29; and <u>&gt;</u>30); family 
  income (quartiles of per capita income) and height (quartiles). To determine 
  which of these variables presented independent associations with the error in 
  the weight and height information, multiple linear regression analysis was performed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To assess the concordance between the measured and
self-reported weights and heights, the intraclass correlation
coefficient was calculated. This coefficient was chosen because,
as well as evaluating the correlation between groups of values,
it is also a good measurement for concordance (reproducibility),
since it takes into consideration the variability between
individuals, i.e. the systematic tendency towards underestimation
or overestimation.<sup>15</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The validity of the BMI obtained from the self-reported
weights and heights was analyzed by means of the sensitivity and
specificity for classifying the BMI correctly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistical analyses were corrected according to the
complex delineation of the sample, by means of the SVY set of
commands in Stata, which consider the complex structure of the
sample by using the weights associated with each sample cluster
and the sampling design effect. The significance level was set at
5%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interviews were conducted after the individuals had signed
a statement of consent. The study protocol was approved by the
Ethics Committee for Human and Animal Medical Research of
Hospital das Cl&iacute;nicas, Universidade Federal de
Goi&aacute;s.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews were conducted with 1,023 individuals, of whom 628
(61.4%) were women and 395 (38.6%) were men. There was no
significant difference between the men and women with regard to
age, schooling and per capita income, and these means were,
respectively: 37.8 years <i>vs</i> 37.6 years; 8.0 years
<i>vs</i> 7.90 years; and 2.1 minimum wages <i>vs</i> 1.8 minimum
wages. Comparison between the excluded and studied individuals
did not show any difference in relation to age and BMI categories
(data not presented).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The men presented 
  a tendency to overestimate their weight by a mean of 0.44 kg, without statistical 
  significance (p=0.06). The overestimation of weight was significant for younger 
  men (up to 34 years old), for those with greater schooling and for those situated 
  in the third quartile of income and height. The difference with the greatest 
  magnitude observed among the men was for underweight men (BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 
  who overestimated their weight by a mean of around 3 kg. On the other hand, 
  obese men underestimated their weight by a mean of -1.4 kg (p&lt;0.01). Analysis 
  of variance showed that the differences between self-reported and measured weight 
  varied significantly with age (p=0.04), schooling (p=0.03) and BMI (p&lt;0.01) 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t1.gif">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The women tended 
  to underestimate their weight, but without statistical significance. Analysis 
  of the differences, according to the categories of the variables studied, showed 
  that the underestimation of weight was only significant for women aged 35 to 
  44 years, for those situated in the third quartile of income, and for obese 
  women (p&lt;0.01). Underweight and normal weight women overestimated their weight 
  by a mean of 0.81 kg and 0.27 kg (p&lt;0.01), respectively. The differences 
  between self-reported and measured weight varied significantly with age (p&lt;0.01) 
  and BMI (p&lt;0.01) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t2.gif">Table 2</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the multiple linear regression, only the BMI presented an
independent association with the error in weight information, for
both sexes. For each increase of 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in BMI, the
difference between self-reported and real weight decreased by
0.28 kg (95% CI: -0.40 to -0.16; p&lt;0.001) for the men and by
0.1 kg (95% CI: -0.16 to -0.04; p&lt;0.01) for the women. This
occurred because the underweight individuals had stated their
weight with a greater differential than had the overweight
individuals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The intraclass 
  correlation coefficients between the self-reported and measured weight were 
  0.96 and 0.97, for the men and women, respectively. A high degree of concordance 
  was observed for all the categories of the variables analyzed, for both sexes 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t1.gif">Tables 1</a> and <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t2.gif">2</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The distribution 
  of the differences between self-reported and measured weight showed that 95% 
  of the weights reported by the men were between -7.9 kg and 8.0 kg and for the 
  women between -5.7 kg and 5.4 kg. The weight was stated with a difference <u>&gt;</u>2 
  kg (<u>&lt;</u>-2 or <u>&gt;</u>+2 kg) by 45% of the men and 31% of the women. 
  Only 10.5% of the women stated their weight with an error <u>&gt;</u>4 kg, while 
  for the men this figure was 20.3%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The men overestimated 
  their height by a mean of 0.91 cm (p&lt;0.01), and the biggest magnitudes were 
  observed for men between 55 and 64 years old (1.57 cm) and for those of shortest 
  stature (2.11 cm). The differences between reported and measured height varied 
  significantly with BMI (p&lt;0.01) and height (p&lt;0.01) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t1.gif">Table 
  1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the women, 
  height was overestimated by 2.2 cm (p&lt;0.01). Height was significantly overestimated 
  in all categories of the variables investigated (age group, schooling, income, 
  BMI and height). The greatest magnitudes were observed for the oldest women 
  (3.33 cm), for those with least schooling (2.63 cm) and shortest stature (3.16 
  cm) and for those situated at the extremes of the BMI classifications: underweight 
  (3.66 cm) and obese (3.40 cm) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t2.gif">Table 2</a>). The 
  differences between self-reported and measured height varied significantly with 
  age, schooling, BMI and height (p&lt;0.01).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the men, an independent association with the error in
height information was observed for BMI and height. For the
women, the error was independently associated with schooling and
height. In the model for the men, every 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
increased the difference in the height information by 0.12 cm
(95% CI: 0.05 to 0.20; p&lt;0.01), and each centimeter reduced
the difference in height by 0.10 cm (95% CI: -0.16 to -0.03;
p&lt;0.01). In the model for the women, each year of schooling
reduced the error in the height information by 0.05 cm (95% CI:
-0.09 to -0.01; p=0.03) and each centimeter in height reduced the
error by 0.09 cm (95% CI: -0.13 to -0.01; p=0.03).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The intraclass 
  correlation coefficients between self-reported and measured height were 0.92 
  and 0.83, for men and women, respectively. These values were smaller than the 
  coefficients observed for weight, thus indicating that self-reported height 
  was less valid than weight, particularly among the women (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t1.gif">Tables 
  1</a> and <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t2.gif">2</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The distribution 
  of the differences between self-reported and measured height showed that 95% 
  of the values reported by the men were between -6.0 cm and 7.6 cm and for the 
  women between -5.0 cm and 11.1 cm. Around 55% of the men and 57% of the women 
  stated their weight with a difference of <u>&gt;</u>2 cm, and 9.3% of the men 
  and 23.4% of the women overestimated their height by 5 cm or more.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean BMI obtained 
  from the self-reported weights and heights was lower than the mean BMI calculated 
  from the measured values (p&lt;0.01), and in a more accentuated manner among 
  the women. For both sexes, the greatest underestimates were observed for the 
  oldest individuals, for obese individuals and for those of shorter stature. 
  The differences between self-reported and measured BMI varied significantly 
  with BMI and height for the men (p&lt;0.01), and with age, schooling, BMI and 
  height for the women (p&lt;0.01). Despite these differences, a high correlation 
  (0.97) was observed between self-reported and measured BMI, for the mean and 
  the women (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t1.gif">Tables 1</a> and <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/e15t2.gif">2</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering the 
  measured BMI as the standard, it was observed that 25.1% of the men and 3.2% 
  of the women who were underweight were classified as normal using the self-reported 
  BMI. At the other extreme, 10.2% of the obese men and 28.3% of the obese women 
  were classified as overweight. Through this, it was observed that for the men, 
  the sensitivities for identifying overweight and obesity were 82.0% and 89.8%, 
  respectively, and were greater than for identifying underweight (74.9%). For 
  the women, the lowest sensitivities were observed for identifying overweight 
  and obesity: 77.2% and 71.7%, respectively (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a> and 
  <a href="#fig2">2</a>). BMI obtained from self-reported weight and height was 
  observed to present high specificity, for all categories of measured BMI, for 
  both sexes. The lowest specificity was observed in the normal (eutrophic) category, 
  which was 88.6% for the men and 84.5% for the women (data not presented as a 
  table).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study showed high concordance between
self-reported and measured weights and heights in a
population-based survey in the city of Goi&acirc;nia. Although
weights and heights were on average reported with small errors,
some subgroups of individuals presented a greater tendency
towards overestimating or underestimating the anthropometric
measurements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question asked in the interviews was "What is your present
weight?". To ensure quality control for the response, it might
have been pertinent to ask beforehand when and where the
individuals had weighed themselves most recently, what type of
balance had been used, and whether they had taken off their shoes
and were only wearing light clothing on that occasion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The differences between the self-reported and measured weights
could have been lower if people with a history of diseases that
cause short-term weight variation (such as diabetes and
infectious diseases) had been excluded. Such diseases decrease
the accuracy with which patients inform their current weight.
Nonetheless, weight is frequently measured in health services,
pharmacies and even in some homes. Thus, the failure to record
these items had little interference in the self-reported weights,
which showed a high intraclass correlation coefficient with
measured weights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other factors that could have interfered in the accuracy of
the self-reported measurements, and which were not assessed in
the present study, are: the frequency with which individuals
weigh or measure themselves; body self-image perception; and the
biotype that the individuals would like to have.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to self-reported height, it was also not asked
when this measurement had been made, by whom and whether the
individuals had taken off their shoes on that occasion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact that the individuals had been told that they would be
weighted and measured may have inhibited the giving of incorrect
information. Some people did not know or did not want to state
their current weight and height. The percentage of men who did
not report their weight and/or height was 8.8% in total. On the
other hand, 14.8% of the women did not report their height, 3.4%
did not report their weight and 4.4% did not report either of
them. Contrary to weight, height is rarely checked among adults.
The smaller number of men who were unable to report their height
was partly due to the fact that they generally remember the
height measured at the time of being called up for military
service. Comparison between the excluded and studied individuals
did not show any difference regarding the age and BMI
categories.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Population-based studies with home interviews conducted by
trained observers make it possible to obtain representative and
standardized information. Obtaining self-reported and measured
data on the same day is a positive point, since a gap between
obtaining them would cause bias in interpreting the discrepancies
between reported and measured values. Moreover, the differences
between the two types of data were evaluated by taking into
consideration the characteristics of the population that could
have an influence on the results, such as age, schooling, income,
BMI and height.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results observed are consistent with previous
studies<sup>4,12</sup> in which a high correlation between
self-reported and measured weights and heights was observed. A
tendency for overweight men and women to underestimate their
weight, while underweight men tend to overestimate their weight,
was also found.<sup>4,6-8,10,12-14</sup> However, contrary to
these studies, no overall underestimation of weight among women
was observed in the present study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Height was overestimated by the men (0.91 cm), with greatest
magnitude among the men of shortest stature (2.11 cm), without
any association with age. Contrary to what was observed in other
population studies, the overestimation of height among men did
not increase significantly with age.<sup>12</sup> For the women,
height was overestimated by 2.22 cm, and this overestimation was
associated with age, schooling and income.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The overestimation of height by shorter and older individuals
has also been observed in several studies, for both
sexes.<sup>4,12</sup> Increasing age has been associated with
increasing error in the height information, partly due to the
fact that people relate to the height they were when they were
younger, and do not take into account the reduction that is
observed during the aging process, which is estimated to be
around 1 cm per decade after reaching 40 years
old.<sup>8,16</sup> On the other hand, overestimation of height
by shorter individuals reinforces the premise of systematic error
guided by cultural standards that value tallness as well as
slimness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present study, the combined effect of the variations in
self-reported weight and height in relation to measured values
acted together such that the BMI was underestimated for both men
and women, except for underweight individuals. The obese men were
the group that was most erroneously classified. The oldest men
and women also underestimated their BMI more than did the
youngest individuals. Other studies have indicated that the use
of recalled information on weight and height for measuring
associations between diseases and increased BMI should be
interpreted with care.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sensitivity for correctly classifying obesity in the
present study was greater for men (89.8%) than for women (71.7%),
mainly because of the greater error in height information from
the women. The sensitivity values for classifying obesity have
varied between different population studies, but greater
sensitivity for classifying women than for men has generally been
observed.<sup>7,10,12,14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sensitivity of self-reported BMI for classifying obesity
that was observed in the present study caused underestimation of
the obesity prevalence by 0.1% for men and 3.4% for women, while
the true prevalence of obesity was 10.4% for men and 13.4% for
women. In the study carried out in the urban area of Porto
Alegre, it was observed that the prevalence of obesity was
underestimated by 1% (for the whole sample).<sup>10</sup> Roberts
(1995)<sup>7</sup> found 2% for both sexes and Spencer et
al<sup>12</sup> (2002) observed underestimation of 5.2% for men
and 3.4% for women. The true prevalence of obesity in these
studies was 10.0%, 8.0% and around 15.0%, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence of obesity based on self-reported weight and
height was close to what was obtained for the measured values.
This makes it possible to use self-reported weight and height in
studies on the prevalence and monitoring of obesity.</font></p>
