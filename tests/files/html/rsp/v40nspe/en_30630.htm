<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An outline and critical analysis of scientific studies on
Violence and Health is presented. On the basis of a
non-exhaustive review, the construction of violence as a national
and international field of knowledge and intervention is
broached. Outbreaks of violence are shown to occupy a broad
domain of social life that reaches practically everyone, in
situations of both war and supposed peace. The unity of violence
as an ethical-political question is highlighted and its extreme
diversity as concrete situations for study and intervention is
demonstrated. Through situating violence as related to
collective, interpersonal and self-reported individual
dimensions, and taking it to be intentional acts of physical
force or power, resulting in physical, sexual or psychological
abuse, and in negligence or deprivation, the studies examined
mostly demonstrate a concern to respond to the widespread sense
that violence is invisible, naturalized and inevitable. In order
to do it, the studies show the high magnitude of violence, and
the possibilities for controlling violence and attending to the
multiplicity of harm to health. The initial approaches flow from
a theoretical-methodological point of view related to social
inequalities, family maladjustment, gender inequalities and, less
frequently, race or ethnic inequalities. These imply
reconstruction of the classical concepts of family, generation
and social class. In conclusion, this problem is considered to be
interdisciplinary and, returning to the notion of social-medical
matters within Social Medicine, updating of this notion is
recommended for topics that are as complex and sensitive as
violence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Violence is recognized nationally and internationally as a
social question within public health. Around the world, it is
considered to be a violation of rights, although with a variety
of expressions within different contexts. Today, there is debate
about the expansion of the domains of violence, paradoxically in
relation to the expansion of human and social rights. From
violence by the State itself, such as in war crimes or
institutional abuse and negligence, it extends to situations of
an interpersonal nature within the private world. To control
violence, it is not enough simply to appeal to individuals'
senses of ethical and social responsibility. It is firstly a
matter of redefining these senses, from a moral and legal point
of view. These considerations point towards the connection
between any approach on violence and human and social rights,
from the ethical and juridical perspective. Similarly point
towards the need of reflectiong on the major approaches to
violences, as spheres of knowledge and social intervention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From health perspective, it was mapped a non-exhaustive survey
the studies on violence, with the objective of presenting the
movement produced, by gathering references to gender,
race/ethnicity and life cycles, as specific domains of
vulnerabilities, that are added to the traditional markers for
social inequality, poverty, family structure or age group.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increase in scientific production and the changes or
expansions of viewpoint that approach violence as a question of
knowledge and intervention are dealt with, taking into account
the perspective of violence as a complex and sensitive topic that
constitutes a medical-social subject within health, and restoring
the approaches operated by social medicine within public
health.<sup>11</sup></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>VIOLENCE AND 
  HEALTH: GENERAL PANORAMA</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first question that can be posed relates to the crisis of
sociability. This is the failure of the current processes of
socialization, produced by contemporaneous difficulties in
maintaining social structures in the light of the growing
dominions of violence. Violence is now identified in public and
private spaces, in institutional, group or interpersonal
relationships, in times of war or during supposed peacetime.
There are not enough means for dealing with such a wide dominion
that is fed by interconnections that are still little known.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impasse in dealing with freedom to exercise social and
human rights in a connected way with correlated social
commitments and ethical and civil responsibilities constitutes
the center of this crisis. It is expressed by a paradoxical
broadening of the notion of rights that, in practical terms is
formed by the blurring of limits in exercising them, in parallel
with a big expansion of these rights. This occurs because
exercising them has been disconnected from the relational sphere
and become increasingly placed as an individual question, thereby
silencing the relational counterparts: duties and commitments.
The achievement of rights is confounded with the satisfaction of
individual desires.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within this equivalence, "the other" matters little, and
freedom to exercise rights is associated with objectification of
"this other", a break with interactivity that violence is founded
on. An ethically ambivalent way of acting is established,
informed by an agenda of fluid values that replace the defined
and delimited value scales. This is malleable according to the
opportunities (almost always market opportunities) and therefore
cannot be long-lasting. It is the adoption of values that are
adaptable to desires and to the expansion of what may or may not
be rights. This movement accompanied the establishment in the
1980s of the era of collapses,<sup>19</sup> with the failure of
policies and interventions that were precisely for protecting the
rights achieved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For this reason, it is relevant to point out the movement
among international bodies like the World Health Organization
(WHO), which in 2002 published the World Report on Violence and
Health.<sup>21</sup> International movements on the one hand have
made the problem of violence public and known around the world,
thus expanding the debate and allowing the construction of
references for the various regional movements. On the other hand,
they add value and significance to the problem of violence,
conferring unity to the problem as a question to be faced, while
at the same time defining types of violence as diversity within
this plural question.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Report reorientates the traditional way of dealing with
health diagnoses for populations, separating deaths due to
violence (homicides and suicides) from other external causes, and
associating these with morbidity data. This reorientation was
accompanied by incorporating new possibilities for approaching
the problem, such that other inequalities were brought in,
alongside the socioeconomic ones that are always mentioned. Of
these, the most frequent ones are gender and, more rarely but
still pertinently, race and ethnicity. This other outlook is
guided by criticism of the traditional concepts that explain
violence: family, generation, social class or nationality-based
identity, which now seem to be insufficient for dealing with the
problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The WHO definitions summarize many of the achievements and
also influence the health field in almost all countries in the
world. Their symbolic impact and the interventions that they may
evoke therefore cannot be disregarded. And in this, the great
contributions of the various social movements and militant
actions towards this end cannot be disregarded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, it is worthwhile exploring this World Report a little
better.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The broadest collocation is violence as a universal challenge,
and the Report is made available as an "instrument against the
taboos, secrets and feelings of inevitability that surround
it".<sup>21</sup> It is highlighted as an undertaking against the
invisibility of violence and its acceptance as a trivial event,
to which "we should more respond to than prevent". It is placed
at the service of the health field, as a critical response to the
usual acceptance of violence as a question essentially relating
to "law and order", in which health professionals just deal with
its consequences. It therefore calls on health professionals and
scientists to also take responsibility for concerning themselves
with and intervening in the fight against violence, in
conjunction with other sectors of society. It thus defines
interdisciplinary knowledge and intersectoral actions in
multiprofessional teams for interventions as urgent topics for
healthcare sciences, policies and programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is evident that there is an alliance at an
ethical-political level and an intersection at the level of
knowledge and practice, promoted between health and human and
social rights. And, insofar as this has a repercussion on health
services, in the search for integration with justice, public
security, education or social assistance, or in scientific
production, it points towards the construction of
interdisciplinary references to found a basis for cooperation
between practices and for solidarity between disciplines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In defining violence as the "intentional use of real or
threatened physical force or power against oneself, against
another person, or against a group or a community, that results
or has the possibility of resulting in injury, death,
psychological damage, development deficiency or privation", the
intentional nature of the violent act is emphasized and
non-intentional incidents are excluded. The use of power is
included, exemplified by threats of aggression or intimidation,
and by neglect and omission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the Report is unclear regarding the concepts of power
and violence themselves, overlapping violence and power, often
leading to the belief that violence is an inexorable part of
power. It thus inadvertently reiterates the inevitability of
violence that its wishes to deny. Another possible confusion is
that, contrariwise, it denies viability to the concept of power
as giving rise to non-violent relationships, thus equally
obscuring the role of social responsibility intrinsic to these
power actions.<sup>42</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Report also proposes the recognition of the immense
proportion of hidden violence that does not result in deaths or
serious injuries, but oppresses and causes physical,
psychological and social damage to individuals who are subjected
to chronic abuse. This is the case of violence within the home
and family, with physical, sexual and psychological aggression,
and also privation and neglect, which especially affect women,
children and old people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A rate of 28.8 violent deaths per 100,000 inhabitants was
estimated in 2000, in a worldwide index adjusted for age. Out of
the total for these deaths, 49.1% were suicides, 31.3% were
homicides and 18.6% resulted from wars. Lower-income countries
represented 91.1% of the total of these deaths, with a
concentration of homicides. There was also a variation according
to sex and age: 77% of the homicides took place among men and
their rate was more than three times the rate for women. It was
greatest in the age groups of 15-29 years (19.4 per 100,000) and
30-44 years (18.7 per 100,000). Sixty percent of the suicides
also occurred among men, and this rate increased with age, such
that in the age group of 60 years or over, it was twice what it
was for women (44.9 per 100,000 <i>versus</i> 22.1 per 100,000
for women).<sup>21</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If taken from the perspective of non-fatal violence, several
authors have pointed out that the data present great difficulties
in comparisons, and variability in their measurements. What is
known is the fruit of surveys on occurrences reported by the
individuals studied, thereby producing underestimates of the
aggression or abuse, as in the case of violence against
women,<sup>17</sup> children and old people.<sup>21</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the one hand, it is recognized that the invisibility of
violence increases in countries that have a culture of accepting
this way of resolving conflicts, especially domestic ones. This
injects fatality regarding violence in interpersonal
relationships in private life or even punishes the victim of the
violence with death. This is the case of deaths among women who
have suffered rape, which is justified in the name of the
family's honor.<sup>17,50</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand, even though analyses dealing with the
ethnic dimension of violence are very rare, there are questions
that are of ethic-cultural nature. One example is the polysemy of
the term violence in different cultures, and the different
contextual possibilities of its revelation.<sup>12,42</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The result from 
  this is great variation in the rate encountered. The example of physical violence 
  by an intimate partner against a woman can be cited, in which this partner is 
  her principal aggressor. Independent studies show a range from 21% in Holland 
  and Switzerland, 22% in the United States and 29% in Canada, to 34.4% in Egypt 
  and 40% in India,<sup>17,50</sup> a variation that could be attributed to differences 
  in designs and samples. Nevertheless, a comparative study in 15 regions of 10 
  countries, including two regions in Brazil &#150; the municipality of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo (SP) and the Forest Zone of Pernambuco (ZMP) &#150; and making use of 
  the same questionnaire, which was always applied to women aged 15 to 49 years 
  and had standardized training for the researchers and standard sample definition, 
  presented a range from 13% (Okahama, Japan) to 61% (Cuzco, Peru), while most 
  of the regions were between 23% and 49%.<sup>12</sup> Brazil was part of this 
  majority group: SP presented a rate of 27% and ZMP 34%.<sup>12,42</sup> Thus, 
  the study added variations within the same country, as in the Brazilian case, 
  to those observed between countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A great degree of overlapping between physical, sexual and
psychological violence has been found, which should also be
expected in relation to violence against children and old people.
In the case of children, which was the first type of violence to
be studied, in the 1960s,<sup>42</sup> there has been an
accumulation of information that is not seen for old people, who
only become the target of research during the second half of the
1990s. The World Report, with data from only five surveys in
developed countries, estimates that 4% to 6% of the elderly
population experience some form of domestic abuse. Among old
people, bad treatment in institutions also has to be taken into
consideration, a topic that has rarely been researched. Questions
of gender or race/ethnicity remain unexplored within this
population group.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to children, attention is drawn to the high
mortality rates that are also unequal according to country and
sex.<sup>21</sup> The homicide rate among children aged zero to
four years (5.2 per 100,000) is more than twice the rate for
those between five and 14 years (2.1 per 100,000). For children
aged less than five, the homicide rate in high-income countries
is 2.2 per 100,000 boys and 1.8 per 100,000 girls, while for
poorer countries the rate is two to three times higher (6.1 per
100,000 boys and 5.1 per 100,000 girls). The greater occurrence
of this violence among boys is reiterated here. With regard to
morbidity, younger children are more exposed to physical violence
(75% in the Philippines and 47% in the United States, in reports
from the parents), while it has been calculated that around 20%
of women and 5 to 10% of men suffered sexual abuse when they were
children. Social inequalities and gender questions are therefore
implicated in violence against children and adolescents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, juvenile violence (10 to 29 years) needs to be
commented on, because of what it represents socially. It is
mentioned by the World Report itself as the most visible form of
violence and it also has peculiar characteristics, since young
people are the main aggressors and victims. Studies on this are
the ones that most point towards the interlinking of fatal and
non-fatal violence; violence in public and domestic spaces;
violence of interpersonal and collective types. Experience of
violence during childhood, belonging to gangs and having access
to arms, living under prolonged war and under conditions of
social exclusion and great poverty, are situations that increase
the indices for such violence, which is greatest in Latin America
and Africa and least among the countries of Eastern
Europe.<sup>21</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following this general panorama, the Brazilian production
regarding violence and health needs to be considered.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>VIOLENCE AND 
  HEALTH IN BRAZILIAN STUDIES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data on the Brazilian production on violence and health were
gathered during the first week of April 2006 from SciELO
(Scientific Electronic Library Online), which among others
indexes the principal Brazilian journals with the field of public
health. A total of 234 articles published between 1980 and 2005
were found, and this last year along accounted for 20% of this
publication. The first surge began in 1994, with the publication
of a supplement by <i>Cadernos de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i><sup>29</sup> relating to this topic. A second
surge began in 2002.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From reading the abstracts, 108 health-related articles that
dealt with Brazilian realities were selected. The points
considered in the following are based on this production, with
the addition of a few complementary studies that are considered
to be sources of relevant original data.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these Brazilian studies, the international trend was
verified: the first studies were based on data on mortality due
to external causes. Such mortality affects males more than
females, and thus, explaining why the studies focus more on
homicide among males, mediated by the question "external causes".
Both the distinction of type of violence and gender-based
approaches begin at the end of the 1990s.<sup>22,25</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1990s, most of the studies were based on the premise
that violence was growing: from 1980 onwards, external causes
occupied second place among the causes of death in Brazil. It was
therefore the external causes that marked the presence of
violence, particularly among men.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the first part of the decade, the studies sought to
characterize the magnitude and importance of these causes of
death in relation to others, discussing rates and years of life
potentially lost, and stratified by groups of causes, sex and
age.<sup>26,38,46</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the first explanatory systematic studies to emerge
regarding the notion of violence took the understanding that it
is a process with multiple causes and non-linear causality, with
specific and general, micro and macrosocial characteristics that
are differentiated and interlinked.<sup>46</sup> This argument
was incorporated in Minayo's conceptual references and violence
categories: "structural", "resistant" and
"delinquent".<sup>29</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the second part of the decade, the number of publications
decreased. However, there was a shift in approaches. Barata et
al<sup>2</sup> focused on the segments of adolescents and young
adults of both sexes in S&atilde;o Paulo, and applied analysis of
the correlation between living conditions and homicide rates. The
analytical mark utilized was structural violence resulting from
the development of metropolises, urban deterioration and
inequalities in living conditions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The period from 2000 to 2005 presented growth in the numbers
of publications within the health field. They mostly investigated
specific cities and dealt with the increases in mortality due to
external causes that were especially the product from the
homicide rate, thus demonstrating that this is one of the biggest
present-day problems within public health.<sup>10,13,31,40</sup>
Among this group of studies the trend towards spatial analysis of
mortality stands out, in an approach towards urban violence
related to inequalities in occupying the spaces within
cities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another question that arose during this period was a more
detailed focus on homicides among young males. A study carried
out in different Brazilian states and their capitals in 2000
showed that there was general growth in the homicide rate in the
country, with figures of between 11.83 per 100,000 inhabitants in
Salvador and 67.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in Recife, thus
denoting significant differences in the risk of death between
Brazilian cities.<sup>35</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This focus was repeated by other studies during this period.
The main reference point for them was analyses supported by the
concept of structural violence and violence in and due to public
space affected by social inequalities, or according to WHO
typology, interpersonal community-based violence.<sup>21</sup>
Macedo et al<sup>23</sup> summarized the principal determining
factors for this violence: "(....) growth in socioeconomic
inequalities; low salaries and family income that lead to loss of
purchasing power; absence of integrated public policies in
keeping with the population's health, education, housing and
security needs; priority for economic development to the
detriment of social development, with sacrifice for the
population and greater burdens on the poor; and intense appeals
to consumption that conflict with the impoverishment of the
country"<i>.</i> In addition to these factors, there is the
consolidation of organized crime, especially in the metropolitan
regions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, the possible approaches, whether as violence of
delinquency,<sup>29</sup> or gender questions among male
peers,<sup>43</sup> or ethnic-racial questions,<sup>3</sup> do
not significantly appear. It was also between 2000 and 2005 that
studies on external causes using morbidity data gained greater
visibility. Some were highlighted by combining mortality and
morbidity data.<sup>15,24,47</sup> In 2000, external causes
represented 5.2% of all hospitalizations in
Brazil.<sup>15</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One noteworthy study using the gender category took violence
as a constitutive trait of masculinity and made men both the
villains and victims of violence.<sup>47</sup> Using data
relating to external causes, for Brazil and state capitals from
1991 to 2000, the study showed that the homicide risk was almost
12 male deaths for every female death.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Age groupings in morbidity-mortality studies on external
causes have, as already shown, focused on male populations,
especially younger males. This was justified by the magnitude and
seriousness of the problem among these populations. Two
references to deaths and hospitalization among elderly people
must also be highlighted among these general studies on external
causes. One of them,<sup>14</sup> showed that the mortality among
people aged 60 years or over due to external causes was 92.1 per
100,000 inhabitants (135.3 per 100,000 for men and 56.8 per
100,000 for women) in 2000. In terms of morbidity, the study
revealed that most hospitalizations resulted from injuries and
trauma caused by falls and crushing. The other study<sup>30</sup>
took the period 1980-1998 and showed that, among the external
causes, the ones responsible for most elderly victims were
traffic and transport accidents, falls and homicides. Focusing on
the latter cause, this study showed growth from 7.2% in 1980 to
9.6% in 1988.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these studies, violence is dealt with as a question within
the everyday life of families, institutions and society.
Approaches like gender or race/ethnicity do not appear.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies on women, on the one hand, and on children and
adolescents, on the other, have a much greater presence than
studies on the elderly. The first studies on these two fields
(women and children/adolescents) were published in
1994.<sup>29</sup> Thus, even though they began before studies on
the elderly, they are very recent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although these two fields are not mutually related, they have
points in common: a concern for giving visibility to the problem,
the high rates encountered and the difficulties that health
professionals have in dealing with the question in their daily
routines. The great majority are studies in services specializing
in dealing with violence and health services, and they
investigate prevalences, the nature of the violence and the
aggressors. They also explore questions such as: records and
notification, assessment of the service, reports on experiences,
and proposals and criticisms relating to intervention practices.
The need for multiprofessional teams, intersectoral
characteristics and the defense of violence as a public health
problem, interlinked with care and the preservation of human and
social rights, have been constant arguments. References to laws,
conventions, statutes and other regulations, and to international
treaties to which Brazil is a signatory, have also been cited
among these studies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the studies on violence against women, great importance was
given to the notion of gender, and this was also utilized in a
small proportion of the studies relating to children and
adolescents. Both fields utilized the terms of violence within
the home or family, but the approach and emphasis given to the
idea of family differed greatly, as did the defense of the
individual rights of the subjects involved in defending the
family and its integrity. The topic of family had little presence
in the scientific production on violence relating to women, but
was almost obligatory in the field of children and adolescents,
in which mothers and fathers were recalled as aggressors and
subjects fundamental in interventions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poverty and social inequality were important references, and
were recalled and placed in relation to the topics of family and
gender.<sup>6,7</sup> Ethnicity and race were topics absent from
both these fields. When cited, these questions appeared in the
plans for future studies or for characterizing the sample
studied, and were little used in the analysis. In the few cases
in which skin color was a variable analyzed, it did not present
an association with the forms of violence
studied.<sup>44</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was noteworthy that there was a virtual absence of studies
making in-depth analyses of the prevention of violence and the
role of health in this topic. The only article found discussed
the lack of such policies in the public health sector in
Fortaleza.<sup>37</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The methodologies utilized in the studies on women, children
and adolescents varied. The studies were presented as
quantitative analyses for identifying occurrences and defining
associated factors, and as qualitative analyses in studies on
representative bodies for women and professionals. Several
studies combined these methodologies, thus indicating the
complexity of the subject and the innovation in the approach.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Focusing on violence against women, two articles can be
highlighted as references for this field,<sup>16,18</sup> in
which the inequalities in gender relations are a central concept
present from the outset of this production. The violence suffered
by women is explained from the historical and social conditions
of the relational construction of the male and female. Thus,
attributes, positions and diverse expectations are generated for
the sexes in related to sexuality, position in the core of the
family, work and public space, thereby giving rise to specific
forms of violence: in private spaces against women and in public
spaces against men.<sup>16</sup> This division of the spaces for
violence and the appeal for a gender-based approach also in
studies on men was already indicated in these first publications.
However, studies on men from this gender perspective only
appeared at the end of the period.<sup>43</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The designation gender violence itself has not always been
used. Imprecision of the terms has continued and, although gender
is a fundamental category, the perspective directly relating to
violence has been little studied. There has also been little
differentiation between power and violence in gender

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most studies on violence against women were conducted in
health services, basic health units,<sup>20,41</sup>
hospitals,<sup>8</sup> maternity hospitals<sup>28</sup> and
emergency services.<sup>44</sup> They have been restricted to the
clientele of the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i>
(Brazilian National Health System). They mainly present "violence
against women": some delimited to domestic violence<sup>8</sup>
and other to violence by an intimate partner.<sup>1,20</sup> Up
to 2005, the only population-based study published presented the
topic of violence against women as part of an investigation on
women,<sup>49</sup> showing that 43% of Brazilian women declared
that hey had suffered violence from men at some time in their
lives, 33% some form of physical violence, 13% sexual violence
and 27% psychological violence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The studies in services indicated higher rates: between 36%
and 45% suffering physical violence at least once in their lives
and between 9% and 19% sexual violence,<sup>20,41,44</sup> with
the partner as the most frequent aggressor. The rate of violence
during pregnancy has been estimated to be 7.4%.<sup>28</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overlapping of the physical, sexual and psychological forms
has been indicated, and combined forms prevail: physical with
psychological violence and sexual with physical
violence.<sup>20,41</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies dealing with sexual violence against women are
centered on the quality of the services that attend to such
cases, and on the representative bodies for professionals and
women regarding legal abortion.<sup>33,45,48</sup> However, these
services tend to especially receive cases of violence committed
by strangers, whether identifiable or not. These cases are very
different from sexual violence in conjugal relations, which is
more frequent and more invisible.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to the segment of children and adolescents, the
studies were also located in specialized services and attendance
for victims of violence (shelters, centers for attending to
accusations, or referral centers). Their clientele was therefore
composed of victims of violence. Without being prevalence
studies, these studies showed differences according to the sex
and age of the children and adolescents who suffered these
attacks, and mostly indicated greater frequency of sexual
aggression against girls<sup>39</sup> and physical violence
against boys.<sup>4,7</sup> They indicated the mothers as the
main aggressors regarding physical violence, followed by the
father.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding sexual violence, which has been greatly studied,
fathers and stepfathers were the main aggressors. Criticisms of
families and analysis from gender references had little presence,
with rare combined approaches towards violence against children
and mothers within families.<sup>27,32</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies on the prevalence of violence against children and
adolescents were based on schools, thus coming close to
population-based studies. One of them, in Porto Alegre, found
that 2.3% of the adolescent subjects reported sexual violence,
4.5% had witnessed this type of violence and 27.9% knew some
victim of sexual violence, among 1,193 eighth-grade students in
state schools.<sup>36</sup> Another study in S&atilde;o
Paulo,<sup>5</sup> on 993 adolescents (12-18 years old) in the
state network and 815 in the private network, found that 8.6% of
them reported suicide attempts, 7.9% aggression against them or
others and 4.8% were carrying firearms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking all the points considered together, the diversity of
the approaches and some important absences can be highlighted.
The absences relate to specific population segments and important
focuses that have not been dealt with, such as race/ethnicity and
even gender. If on the one hand this shows the complexity of the
topic of violence, in which great dispersion of treatment is
required for its concrete and particular expressions, on the
other hand there is an understanding that studies on violence and
health are still at an initial stage of their production.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of the present efforts appear to be concentrated on the
concern for making the problems visible, the emphasis on
magnitudes or the difficulties in transforming this into a
question for the health field. Even if momentarily, this shifts
undertakings that examine the conditioning factors for violence,
particularly in relation to impasses, aforementioned, to dealing
with rights and commitments, freedoms and ethics,
simultaneously.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The research accomplished has certainly contributed towards
progressive comprehension of the problem from the concrete and
particular perspectives of the situations studied. It has also to
a certain extent contributed towards comprehending the
participation of violence in social structures, in a general
manner. However, there is a pressing need for a more direct
approach in this direction, to expand the still hesitant critical
construction of classical concepts that in studies on violence
may obscure important aspects of relationships between subjects,
relationships relating to power and concomitant exercising of
rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of this plurality that violence signifies; or the
radical human experience that it represents, through invalidating
the subject; or furthermore, the exposure of spaces and moments
of great intimacy and privacy of each person, there is an
understanding that there cannot be progress in studying it
without taking it as a complex and sensitive study subject. This
relates to solidarity between disciplines and not competition,
and requires a particular scientific approach in which
methodology combines with ethics.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The traditional debate between natural sciences (and their
manner of objectifying the event studied) and human and social
sciences, in which the field of public health is situated has
characterized the interdisciplinary perspective of topics that
are as much medical-health as social. In this light, the concept
of "medical-social study subjects" is highlighted for postulating
the integration of medical and health disciplines, through a
historical rereading of the reference that has already served for
public health. With this designation, violence can certainly be
recognized, as can other topics (exercising of sexuality or drug
abuse, for example), in a way that is more connected to
development of health than as a response to disease.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The term medical-social, coined from social medicine,
represented the need to create a field that would be concerned
with the social aspects of the health-disease process and health
services. It had the aim of questioning the reduction of social
matters through the natural science approach, which reproduces
the medical interpretation of illness and health interventions,
thereby subjecting scientific knowledge to the supremacy of
biology and all health practices to the supremacy of the clinical
approach, with all the implications that this carries in terms of
the health care and health work model.<sup>9,34</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The way violence is studied now needs to be updated because of
the ethical requirements of the methodologies, the pluralism of
this study subject and the relational aspects of human
interactivity that are inherent to it.</font></p>
