<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Collective Health is characteristically a broad and complex
field of study, presenting itself as a major challenge for the
evaluation process carried out by Capes. The aim of the present
work was to provide a panorama of postgraduate education in the
field of collective health and to discuss aspects of the criteria
adopted for its evaluation. The evaluation of postgraduate
programs is carried out on a yearly basis. For this, program
structure, its academic staff and students, research and teaching
activities, theses and dissertations, and intellectual production
are taken into account. The evaluation of the latter has been
subject of criticism for favoring the publication of papers and
for basing ranking of production on journal indexing and impact
factors. Despite criticisms and reservations towards the
evaluation process, the analysis of the Brazilian scientific
production, in general and in the case of Collective Health,
shows a very positive scenario, with an important increase in the
number of postgraduate courses, teachers, and students. Thus, the
panorama of postgraduate programs is favorable, but continuously
rethinking and perfecting the evaluation process is essential to
guarantee its contribution to the growth and strengthening of the
system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The history of collective health in Brazil, as is often the
case in this country, is the result of a long process, begun in
the late nineteenth century, the time of Oswaldo Cruz' struggle
against yellow fever and other contagious diseases. This history
is outlined by Nunes<sup>11</sup> in a recent article, where
several other references may be found. Throughout this process,
the collective health area has incorporated ideas of political
character, derived from the social sciences and linked to public
health issues, but in which public health remained as the major
objective. From this perspective, the biological sciences in
general, and medicine in particular, have always had a dedicated
space in the collective health area, as has the quantitative
approach characteristic of epidemiology. In addition to this
diversity, the ever faster progress in technology and knowledge
have brought collective health into closer contact with other
fields of knowledge, such as engineering, genetics, pharmacology,
chemistry, architecture, and economics.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this context, 
  collective health places in intense &#150; and often uncomfortable &#150; proximity 
  professionals from various areas, with different work tools, and frequently 
  with very distinct immediate goals. Such divergence has been the subject of 
  countless reflections on the definition of collective health as a field of knowledge 
  and of its object, as discussed by Nunes.<sup>11</sup> The integration of different 
  areas or disciplines that coexist within the domain of collective health is 
  often insufficient.<sup>10</sup> Nevertheless, there are interesting examples 
  of successful associations, such as the work of Behague et al<sup>2</sup> on 
  caesarian sections in Brazil, which associates an epidemiological survey with 
  ethnographical research, to cite just one example. Ultimately, such diversity 
  provides a range alternatives to approach the various aspects of that which 
  is the point of convergence of the different interests: population health.<sup>5</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Epistemological reflections define collective health as a
"scientific field",<sup>12</sup> or as a "complex disciplinary
domain",<sup>5</sup> rather than as a discipline or specialty of
medicine. The scope and complexity of the area has been the
subject of a large body of literature. A topic of intense debate
within this literature is the evaluation of postgraduate programs
in the field of collective health,<sup>5,9</sup> which is the
object of the present article.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although scarce when compared to other areas, postgraduate
programs in collective health show an impressive diversity.
Subjects covered include environmental and occupational health;
epidemiological surveillance, from endemic diseases to medication
use; sociological, anthropological, and historical aspects of
health, disease, and health care, including the evaluation of
health care systems, programs, and services; and epidemiology
applied to prevention, from primary prevention, at the policy
level, to tertiary prevention, closely related to clinical
medicine and surgery. Its intimate association with different
levels of management in the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de
Sa&uacute;de</i> (SUS - Brazilian Health System) is another
important characteristic of collective health in Brazil, the
area's scientific capital being fundamental for the definition of
policies in a system that is intended to be universal, integral,
and equitable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the evaluation process currently conducted by the
<i>Coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o de Aperfei&ccedil;oamento de
Pessoal de N&iacute;vel Superior</i> (Capes - Coordination for
the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel) faces the
challenge of understanding and valorizing a diverse and complex
area, which is expected to increase in quantity and quality due
to its strategic importance to the country. Thus, the aim of the
present article was to describe the process of evaluation of
Brazilian postgraduate programs by Capes, and to discuss certain
aspects relevant to public health, especially regarding the value
attributed to of scientific output.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>EVALUATION: 
  OBJECTIVES, STRATEGIES, AND CRITERIA</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The primary aim 
  of the Capes evaluation process is to "promote the evolution of the entire <i>Sistema 
  Nacional de P&oacute;s-Gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> (SNPG - National Postgraduate 
  System), and of each individual program, by setting goals and challenges that 
  express current advancements in science and technology and the increase of national 
  competence in this field",<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  In addition, other goals include "contributing to the improvement of each individual 
  program", "contributing to the increase in program efficiency", and "providing 
  subsidy for the definition of postgraduate development policies and bases for 
  decision making by governmental agencies regarding investments". In parallel 
  to goals related to the progress of and the investment of public resources in 
  postgraduate education, a further goal, dealing with the laws regulating postgraduate 
  education, is to "provide the basis, in terms of current regulations, for the 
  National Education Council's appraisal regarding the authorization, recognition, 
  and renewal of recognition of Brazilian Master's and Doctoral programs &#150; 
  a legal requirement for such programs to emit diplomas with national validity, 
  recognized by the Ministry of Education".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This last goal is especially important in a country where the
demand for postgraduate training is large, and poorly met by the
public higher education network. Without proper regulations and
accreditation, the postgraduate system in Brazil would be easy
prey for institutions more concerned with profit than with
providing high-quality training. This could reach enormous
proportions in an academic milieu in which the evaluation of
merit is strongly associated with the degrees one has obtained.
Therefore, requiring a minimal degree of quality from
postgraduate programs is an important role for this process,
although it is not the main focus of evaluation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The evaluation of established programs (recommended by Capes)
is currently coordinated by a representative and an associate
coming from the field being evaluated, who receive direct aid
from a team indicated by the representative and sanctioned by
Capes. The task of this Evaluation Committee is to evaluate
programs on a three-year basis and to revise and update
evaluation criteria in consonance with researchers in the field,
represented by the Forum of Postgraduate Program Coordinators,
and, in the case of collective health, by the
<i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de
P&oacute;s-gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o em Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i>
(Abrasco - Brazilian Association of Collective Health
Postgraduate Programs). Evaluation is divided into two stages:
the continuous evaluation of program evolution (or lack thereof),
which takes place during the first two years and does not alter
the grade received by the course, and the triennial evaluation,
which occurs during the last year, and which, based on the
information accumulated throughout the entire three-year period,
leads to the revision of the program's current grade.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Programs are graded 
  as follows: 2 (insufficient, leading to the interruption of the program's activities), 
  3 (regular), 4 (good), and 5 (very good). Programs considered as "outstanding" 
  and which include doctoral training may receive grades 6 and 7. These grades 
  require clear international insertion, in addition to a strong academic output. 
  Programs are evaluated based on seven items: program purpose, faculty, research 
  activities, training activities, students, theses and dissertations, and intellectual 
  output. The evaluation form currently in use was introduced in 1997, when Capes 
  promoted an extensive revision of the evaluation process. On this occasion, 
  each area was required to define, within certain limits, the weight of the criteria 
  that were part of each item. This contribution from the evaluated field itself 
  was part of a movement towards peer-reviewed evaluation. Despite the participation 
  of all areas in the revision of the evaluation form, an overall change in philosophy 
  was obvious, and Fonseca<sup>6</sup> (2001) considered that the room for maneuver 
  within each area was limited. A new five-section form that includes socially 
  relevant indicators was recently approved by Capes (June 2006) and will undergo 
  a similar weighting process before it is used in the next evaluation. Current 
  forms and criteria may be obtained from the Capes website.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most controversial and widely debated criteria are,
without doubt, those related to intellectual output. The revision
of the evaluation process prioritized the divulgation of
intellectual output in wide-circulation media, essentially
journals. In many areas, intellectual output began to be
classified according to the characteristics of journals. Journals
were classified using a system named "Qualis",<sup>3</sup> which
considers both circulation and impact factor. This system
predicts three levels of quality (A, B, and C) and three levels
of circulation (international, national, and local). In the great
area of health sciences (medicine i, ii, and iii, nursing,
dentistry, pharmaceutics and physical therapy/physical education,
and collective health), the following criteria were defined:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International 
    A and B: journals indexed in the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences 
    Citation Index of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), currently 
    named Thomson Scientific.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
    Journals with impact factors above the median of the evaluation area are considered 
    as level A, and all others as level B.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International 
    C: journals indexed in the MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts 
    (IPA), International Nursing Index (INI); Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp; 
    Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), SportDiscus, ERIC, Tropical Diseases Bulletin, 
    Sociological Abstracts, and Planning/Policy &amp; Development databases.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National A: 
    journals indexed in the SciELO (Scientific Eletronic Library Online) database.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National B: 
    journals indexed in the LILACS (<i>Literatura Latino-Americana de Ci&ecirc;ncias 
    da Sa&uacute;de</i>), EMBASE Excerpta Medica, and Psyclit/PsycInfo, databases, 
    or by national scientific societies representative of the area of evaluation.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National C: 
    other journals. This category does not apply to health sciences.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a decision supported by intense debate at the Forum of
Postgraduate Program Coordinators and Abrasco, three journals
considered as central to the divulgation of knowledge and as
essential for dialogue between researchers in collective health
were classified as Qualis International A: <i>Revista de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> (FSP/USP), <i>Cadernos de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> (ENSP/Fiocruz), and <i>Revista
Panamericana de Salud P&uacute;blica</i> (OPAS).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FAR FROM A CONSENSUS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Criticisms to the postgraduate evaluation process, in the form
of articles, letters, and e-mails, have been frequent. Despite
criticisms, the evaluation process only makes sense if thought of
as an instrument for fostering the development of postgraduate
programs, based on the views of the members of the area itself,
and which indicates the best course to be followed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The great majority of criticisms to the evaluation of
collective health are not against evaluation per se, that is, are
not against the concept of evaluating, but are mostly
constructive in character, aiming to improve the evaluation
process. Restrictions have been made to certain aspects of the
evaluation process, or of the criteria employed. One of these is
related to the inadequacy of current criteria to the typical
output of social sciences, traditionally based on books and book
chapters. Such output would be less valued than journal articles
by current criteria, placing social science researchers in
disadvantage. Another issue concerns authorship. Publications
with multiple authors are frequent in clinical and
epidemiological studies, whereas a book with a single author
contributes as a single publication to the author and to the
program to which he or she belongs (issues concerning the time
necessary for the maturation and production of a book, as well as
its "shelf life" are beyond the scope of the present
article).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From this perspective, it is important that the diversity of
production and the characteristics of each field be acknowledged
and respected, both internally and by other areas, and that they
be contemplated equally by evaluation criteria. Although this is
an easy enough statement to make, the practical implementation of
such criteria is complex, due to the need, at some point, to
establish an equivalency between articles and books or
chapters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another frequent 
  point of criticism is the exclusive use of the ISI/Thomson Scientific impact 
  factor for journal classification. The way in which journal impact is calculated 
  in this system does not allow for direct comparison between journals from different 
  areas, or even different sub-areas.<sup>13</sup> Major factors contributing 
  to this are journal density (i.e., the mean number of citations in articles 
  of a given journal) and rate of obsolescence. The impact factor is directly 
  proportional to both these variables, so that areas with many citations per 
  article, and in which most citations of an article are made soon after its publication 
  have the greatest impact factors. Thus, mean impact values in different fields 
  of knowledge show wide variation &#150; for instance, 0.6 for social sciences, 
  1.7 for clinical medicine, and 3.1 for biological sciences.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other problems related to the use of a single impact factor as
an evaluation criterion include the lapse of time necessary for a
group of authors to produce an article and cite an article that
has been read. If this lapse is long, the citation will not
revert into impact, given that it will occur outside the
evaluation period of ISI/Thomson Scientific. Finally, the impact
factor of a journal is strongly determined by the presence, in
the system, of other authors that regularly cite its articles. In
collective health, the eventual entry of the <i>Cadernos de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> into citation index calculations
will increase the impact factor of the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i>, given that the denominator (number of
articles published) will remain the same, but the numerator
(number of citations received computed by the system) will
increase due to the strong dialogue between these two
journals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SciELO system also publishes bibliometric indices similar
to those calculated by ISI/Thomson Scientific, including two and
three-year impact factors, immediacy index, and half-life. Of the
140 Brazilian journals indexed, <i>Cadernos de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica, Ci&ecirc;ncia &amp; Sa&uacute;de Coletiva,
Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>, and <i>Revista
Latino-americana de Enfermagem</i> occupy the second to fifth
positions in the impact factor ranking (two years) for 2005, with
impact values ranging from 0.59 to 0.47. On the other hand,
Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research and
<i>Mem&oacute;rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz</i>, the Brazilian
journals with greatest impact in the ISI/Thomson Scientific index
(0.82 and 0.74, respectively), are given lower scores by the
SciELO system: 0.12 and 0.29, respectively. Such discrepancies
underscore the relativity with which impact factors must be
considered for the evaluation of quality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The considerations presented above do not intend to invalidate
impact factor as a measure of relevance of a journal or
publication. What should be kept in mind are the limitations and
actual meaning of such indices. According to Amin,<sup>1</sup>
the impact factor is a very useful measure of citation, but is
not a direct measure of quality, and should thus be used with
caution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, other points of debate include the
"publication-centered" view of postgraduate education, without
considering the quality of the thesis/dissertation "product", its
social relevance, and other technical output, including support
to SUS (<i>latu sensu</i>). However, the evaluation of some of
these other forms of output is set back by difficulties related
to the operationalization of evaluation criteria, as is the case
with social relevance, which is also sought in the field of
education.<sup>8</sup> The new evaluation form recently approved
by Capes shows an attempt to advance in this subject, including a
section on "social insertion", with indices of educational,
social, technological, and economic impact, as well as indicators
of solidarity between postgraduate programs and of their
visibility and transparency.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>EVALUATING THE 
  EVALUATION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given this, it is pertinent to ask whether evaluation has been
beneficial to Brazilian postgraduate education in general, and to
the collective health area in particular. As is the case with the
evaluation of a health intervention, a more specific answer to
this question would require a controlled study, in which a
"treated" group would be compared to a "control" group. But such
technological innovation is dispensable if the evaluator is
satisfied with results that indicate that the desired direction
is being taken (adequacy evaluation).<sup>7</sup> Thus, we
present a panorama of the evolution of postgraduate education in
recent years as an indication of the adequacy of the evaluation
process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2004, Capes 
  elaborated the <i>Plano Nacional de P&oacute;s-gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> (PNPG 
  - National Postgraduate Plan) for the 2005-2010 period.<sup>4</sup> The PNPG 
  presents a retrospective of the evaluation process since its beginning, in 1976, 
  showing some impressive results. In the 14 years between 1976 and 1990, the 
  number of postgraduate programs more than doubled, from 673 to 1,485. This number 
  again almost doubled after another 14 years, reaching 2,993 in 2004. The number 
  of teachers in these programs showed a similar trend, increasing from 17,542 
  (tenured teachers) in 1990 to 32,354 (total teachers) in 2003.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
  The increase in number of degrees conferred was even greater &#150; a 4.8-fold 
  increase, from 5,737 in 1990 to 27,630 in 2003. In other words, the degree/teacher 
  ratio more than doubled in the period.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This same report<sup>4</sup> 
  showed that growth of scientific output indexed by ISI/Thomson Scientific was 
  also much greater than the increase in the number of teachers. ISI-indexed publications 
  increased from 3,566 in 1990 to 12,596 in 2003. In other words, the mean number 
  of ISI publications per teacher practically doubled in the period. Curiously, 
  the mean number of citations received by Brazilian publications remained stable 
  (at around nine) until 1996, when a decreasing trend started (<a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30621f2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The collective 
  health area showed an increase in the number of programs and in scientific output 
  in the form of articles between 2001 and 2004.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2001, 952 articles 
  were published, versus 1,360 in 2004 (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30621t1.gif">Table 1</a>). 
  The increase in output published in Qualis International A/B journals was even 
  greater &#150; 51%. However, the proportion of articles published in such journals 
  over the total number of articles published increased only slightly, from 55% 
  in 2001 to 60% in 2004. <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30621t1.gif">Table 1</a> suggests an 
  increase in the publication of articles in journals of all categories, thus 
  maintaining proportionality between Qualis categories.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are striking differences between programs in terms of
the percentage of total output published in Qualis International
A/B journals, which ranged from 9% to 72%. Most programs
published 20-30% of their output in International A/B journals,
with a median value of 34%. Of the 32 programs, five had more
than 50% of their output published in International A/B journals.
As to the grades attributed to programs by Capes, there was a
consistent difference in this regard (p=0.015), courses with
grades 3, 4, 5, and 6, showing mean values of 29, 33, 45, and
54%, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 2001-2004 
  period, over 4,500 papers in the collective health area were published in 1,354 
  journals. The 12 journals most used accounted for one third of this output (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30621t2.gif">Table 
  2</a>). The first four journals account for 25% of published articles, with 
  the first three of these corresponding to the greatest impact factors in the 
  SciELO system, with the exception of one journal from the agrarian sciences 
  area (with an impact factor of 0.82). One-half of the output in the field was 
  published in the 60 most used journals, of which the least used had published 
  nine articles. This group of 60 included eight international journals, of which 
  Lancet had the greatest number of publications (19), followed by American Journal 
  of Public Health, with 14 publications; International Journal of Epidemiology 
  and Diabetes Care, each with 13 published articles; Bulletin of the World Health 
  Organization and Social Science and Medicine, each with 12 articles; and, finally, 
  Environmental Health Perspectives and Journal of Clinical Microbiology, with 
  nine articles each.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The above presented data show a clear-cut increase in
Brazilian postgraduate education in general and in the collective
health area specifically. From the perspective of adequacy
evaluation, changes have taken place exactly in the direction
desired, from the program perspective. Thus, although specific
aspects of evaluation may still be questioned, it is impossible
attribute a deleterious effect to this process. In a scenario of
low competitiveness, as are Brazilian universities, the
evaluation process seems to work as a driving force. In countries
as the United States or England this role is played by the
dispute for and subsequent maintenance of positions in
universities, given that most teachers are hired for
predetermined periods, using funds from grants and research
projects (soft money).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The progress seen in collective health is evidence of the
area's potential for growth. This growth is necessary to fulfill
the increasing demand from universities and, especially, from
SUS. With this in mind, it is essential to improve evaluation, so
that it may stimulate the growth of segments covered by this
field of evaluation, and, more importantly, so that it may
promote greater and more meaningful integration between these
segments, producing more creative and efficacious responses to
the numerous health problems in Brazil. It is therefore a
priority to discuss issues related to output in the form of books
and book chapters, and to study in depth the different indexing
databases and sources of bibliometric indicators, so as to
optimize the Qualis classification for fulfilling its major
objective, which is to stimulate the publication of articles in
the journals of greatest relevance to the field. From this
standpoint, reaching the appropriate target-audience and
providing open access are aspects that should be valued in
addition to the journal's citation potential.</font></p>
