<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fortieth anniversary of uninterrupted publication of the
<i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> has led us to
republish some articles originally published during the first ten
years of the <i>Revista</i>. These are papers that, because of
their themes or approaches, are capable of reflecting the
scientific production of that time. In so doing, our thought was
to pay homage, through the authors of the republished articles,
to all the authors of more than two thousand articles that the
<i>Revista</i> has published over its first 40 years of
existence. It also seemed to us that this would be an excellent
opportunity to disseminate articles and authors that had an
impact at their time, among the new generations of sanitarians
and health professionals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To select the papers that have been republished in the six
issues of volume 40 of the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i>, we sought to represent the diversity of
themes and subjects that characterizes public health and to give
priority to articles of historical interest or that might
encompass important lessons for today. With these criteria in
mind, and not without great difficulty, given the wealth of
material that we were working on, we arrived at the 12 articles
that have actually been republished.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the aim of making this initiative more interesting for
our readers, we invited renowned Brazilian researchers who have a
tradition of collaboration with the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i> to reread the papers and comment on them. We
impressed on these researchers that they should, in particular,
give consideration to the contribution that these articles
brought to the state of knowledge at the time when they were
produced, the impact that they had on public health practices in
our environment, and the pertinence of their analyses, findings
and conclusions for today. We started the series with
"<i>Hist&oacute;ria da sa&uacute;de p&uacute;blica no Estado de
S&atilde;o Paulo</i>" (History of public health in the State of
S&atilde;o Paulo), by Rodolfo Mascarenhas, with commentaries by
Everardo Duarte Nunes and Luiz Ant&ocirc;nio Teixeira. This
article portrays the history of public health in this State from
1891 to 1970, and highlights the figures of Em&iacute;lio Ribas
and Geraldo de Paula Souza. Also in the first issue of volume 40,
we republished "<i>Situa&ccedil;&atilde;o da rede p&uacute;blica
de assist&ecirc;ncia m&eacute;dico-sanit&aacute;ria na
&aacute;rea metropolitana da Grande S&atilde;o Paulo</i>"
(Situation of the public medical care at the Great S&atilde;o
Paulo, Metropolitan area), by Jo&atilde;o Yunes and Rosa
Bromberg, with commentaries by Gast&atilde;o Wagner Campos and
Paulo Elias. This second article describes, with a wealth of
details, the condition of the care network in the metropolitan
area in 1970. Both articles, according to these commentators,
constitute essential reference points for scholars in the fields
of planning and administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the second issue of this year, we selected two
epidemiological papers that were dedicated to the construction of
epidemiometric models: one applied to tuberculosis dissemination
and the other to the kinetics of Chagas disease. The historical
importance of "<i>Sobre o modelo catal&iacute;tico
revers&iacute;vel aplicado ao estudo da cin&eacute;tica
epidemiol&oacute;gica da infec&ccedil;&atilde;o
chag&aacute;sica</i>" (A study on the epidemiologic kinetics of
the human infection by <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> through the
application of the "reversible catalytic model), by Guilherme
Rodrigues da Silva, and "<i>Modelos Epidemiom&eacute;tricos em
tuberculose &#150; defini&ccedil;&atilde;o de 'estados' e risco de
infec&ccedil;&atilde;o</i>" (Epidemiometric models in
tuberculosis &#150; definition of 'states' and risk of infection), by
Antonio Ruffino-Netto, lies in the reports of modeling that was
done at a time when the use of personal computers had not become
widespread yet and when the highest technology that could be had
was ordinary calculators. For these articles, commentaries were
provided by Cl&aacute;udio Struchiner for the first one and
Cl&aacute;udia Code&ccedil;o and Guilherme Werneck, for the
second one.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the third issue, we republished two contributions on topics
directly related to health policy. The first of these, which was
originally published in the form of an editorial, gave analysis
by teaching staff of the Faculdade de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica
of Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo on the National Health Plan
that was proposed by the then Minister Leonel Miranda. The
article was commented by Jairnilson Paim and C&eacute;lia
Almeida. The second contribution, "<i>Abreugrafia
sistem&aacute;tica em massa: inviabilidade econ&ocirc;mica e
eventuais perigos da exposi&ccedil;&atilde;o a
radia&ccedil;&otilde;es</i>" (Systematic mass
roentgenphotography: economical unviability and eventual danger
regarding exposure to radiation), by Febus Gikovate and Diogo
Pupo Nogueira, questioned the indiscriminate use of abreugraphy
and drew attention to the need for scientific evidence on which
to base public health practices. The commentaries on these
historical contributions were provided by and Mauricio Barreto
and Ant&ocirc;nio Ruffino-Netto.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the fourth issue, we considered the field of health
economics with the paper "<i>Financiamento dos servi&ccedil;os de
sa&uacute;de p&uacute;blica</i>" (Funding for public health
services), by Rodolfo Mascarenhas, and an analysis of the
epidemiological situation of a disease that was very important
during the 1960s and 1970s, through the paper "<i>Estado atual do
problema da poliomielite no munic&iacute;pio de S&atilde;o
Paulo</i>" (Current state of the poliomyelitis problem in
S&atilde;o Paulo municipality), by Vict&oacute;rio Barbosa. The
topical nature of the article by Mascarenhas, which was written
in 1967, is highlighted in the commentaries by S&eacute;rgio
Piola and S&iacute;lvia Porto. On the other hand, the article by
Victorio Barbosa, which was originally published in 1968, can be
regarded as a precursor of the strategy of national vaccination
days, as pointed out well in the commentaries by Jos&eacute;
C&aacute;ssio de Moraes and Jos&eacute; da Silva Guedes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fifth issue highlighted "<i>Plano de amostragem utilizado
no estudo de reprodu&ccedil;&atilde;o humana no distrito de
S&atilde;o Paulo</i>" (Sampling plan utilized in studying human
reproduction in the S&atilde;o Paulo district), by Eunice Pinho
de Castro Silva and with commentaries by Maria Cec&iacute;lia
Alves and Mauricio Vasconcellos, showing the enormous
difficulties in drawing up sampling plans for home surveys at a
time when there was no access to information on census tracts.
The second article of the fifth issue was on initiatives in the
teaching of public health, through the paper "<i>Curso de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica em um semestre</i>" (One-semester
course in Public Health), by Jos&eacute; Maria Pacheco de Souza
et al, relating to the formulation and implementation of the
so-called "short course" in public health. This course, which was
promoted by the great sanitarian Walter Leser, made it possible
for the State of S&atilde;o Paulo Department of Health to have
sanitarians heading all its health centers. The commentaries for
this article were provided by Regina Marsiglia and Joana
Azevedo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, in this sixth and final issue of volume 40, which we
are now presenting to readers, we republish the paper
"Quantification of the Nelson de Moraes Indicator", by
Jos&eacute; and Marilda da Silva Guedes, which highlighted the
formulation of a new health indicator. The commentary for this
article was provided by Ruy Laurenti, and shows that this
indicator has historical value as one of the only Brazilian
contributions towards the "classical indicators" of the World
Health Organization, and was at that time innovative. The second
paper in this issue is "<i>Biogeografia, origem e
distribui&ccedil;&atilde;o da domicilia&ccedil;&atilde;o de
triatom&iacute;deos no Brasil</i>" (Biogeography, origin and
distribution of the domiciliation of triatomines in Brazil), by
Oswaldo Paulo Forattini. In the words of Luiz Jacintho da Silva,
one of the commentators on this article, this was one of the high
points in the body of work produced by this researcher, who
dedicated his whole life to studying the vectors of the principal
endemic diseases in Brazil. According to Luiz Jacintho, it is at
the same time a brilliant contribution towards studying the
natural history of diseases and a fascinating exercise in the
application of entomological and ecological knowledge. This
article also has a commentary by Jos&eacute; da Rocha
Carvalheiro.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To conclude, we 
  would like to thank all the researchers for their kind collaboration, in promptly 
  agreeing to provide commentaries on the articles that we selected and doing 
  so with high quality writing within a short space of time.</font></p>
