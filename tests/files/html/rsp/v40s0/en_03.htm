<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  Universal access to antiretroviral therapy starting from 1996 has changed HIV/AIDS 
  epidemic profile in Brazil. The objective of this study was to review the epidemiology 
  of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> Indicators of temporal trends were developed for Brazilian regions 
  from 1990 to 2003 using the Ministry of Health's databases. Exponential regression 
  models adjusted to the 1990-1996 trends were used to estimate expected values 
  for the entire period.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The proportion of AIDS hospitalizations has not changed over 
  the study period but there was a decrease in hospitalizations among those using 
  ARV therapy. There was a 2.7 growth in those receiving Highly Active Anti-Retroviral 
  Therapy (HAART) from 1997 to 2003. HIV/AIDS incidence and mortality rates rose 
  up to 1995 in all regions. From 1996, there has been a gradual reduction in 
  mortality rates while incidence rates have increased. In all regions, except 
  in the Northern region, expected incidence rates have been greater than the 
  observed ones in the last years but these differences were statistically significant 
  only in the Southeastern and Midwestern regions.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The observed trend can be explained by universal access 
  to ARV therapy in Brazil, which had a significant impact on HIV/AIDS mortality. 
  But other factors, such as years of epidemic, prevention actions, knowledge 
  on HIV/AIDS, years of schooling, need to be considered as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The introduction 
  of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) allied to prevention and control 
  actions against the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually 
  transmitted diseases have changed the HIV/AIDS epidemic profile.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While reverse transcriptase 
  inhibitors have been used in AIDS treatment since 1987, significant advances 
  in HAART have been only possible through studies elucidating HIV infection immunopathogenesis.<sup>3,4,7</sup> 
  Declining trends in HIV/AIDS morbimortality have been seen in development countries 
  even before HAART introduction attributed to prophylaxis and better clinical 
  management of opportunistic infections. However, the advent of protease inhibitors 
  has reinforced this trend.<sup>14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil was one 
  of the first developing countries to ensure universal free access to ARV drugs 
  through the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) available since 1996. A major 
  strategy of the ARV Access Program created by the National Program for STD/AIDS 
  (PN-DST/AIDS) was establishing consensual technical recommendations for antiretroviral 
  therapy by consulting committees (Law 9.313/96). The health care program for 
  those living with HIV/AIDS also includes other actions aiming at reducing hospital 
  admissions by providing specialized outpatient care, day hospital, and home 
  care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All these strategies to halt the epidemic advance have been
built on the involvement of the organized society and federal and
state authorities as well as increasing involvement of local
authorities.<sup>1</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of Brazil the question to be raised is whether,
given the gaps between and within different country regions, the
aforementioned initiatives have had a similar impact to that seen
in developed countries with respect to reducing HIV/AIDS cases
and mortality, opportunistic infections, and hospital admissions.
To better describe changes in the HIV/AIDS epidemic profile in
Brazil taking into consideration regional differences data review
is required. This review intends to contribute to the evaluation
of HIV/AIDS prevention and control actions and the direction of
new interventions in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  had the purpose of evaluating the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil. 
  An analysis of time progress, trends, and disease distribution was carried out 
  by country regions, gender, and exposure category based on data available from 
  the Brazilian Ministry of Health. HAART impact on HIV/AIDS morbimortality was 
  also assessed for the period between 1990 and 2003.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was conducted based on the analysis of secondary
information on HIV/AIDS epidemic in Brazil from the following
government databases: DATASUS, National Disease Surveillance Data
System (SINAN), Mortality Information System (SIM), AIDS
Epidemiological Bulletin, and National Program for STD/AIDS
monitoring system (MONITORAIDS).<sup>20</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The temporal trend analysis of AIDS cases for the years
between 1990 and 2002, and deaths occurring two years after
disease diagnosis included estimates of incidence and mortality
rates for all Brazilian regions and by gender.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exponential regression 
  models adjusted to the 1990-1996 time series, a time period before universal 
  access to HAART, allowed to estimate expected rates for the entire time series 
  and, more importantly, to compare expected and observed rates for the period 
  between 1997 and 2003. That is to say, what would have happened in the time 
  series if prevention and control actions would have been the same as in the 
  years before 1997 throughout the entire epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS AND 
  DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Review of AIDS epidemiology in Brazil</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among Latin American 
  countries, Brazil is the most affected by AIDS epidemic in absolute numbers. 
  It is estimated 1.8 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the region, and a 
  third lives in Brazil. Higher HIV prevalences are seen in smaller countries 
  such as Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  There were reported 371,827 AIDS cases in Brazil from 1980 up to June 30, 2004, 
  and an incidence rate of 17.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants<sup>9</sup> in 2004. 
  National estimates of the number of HIV infected people range around 600,000 
  for the years 1998,<sup>18</sup> 2000<sup>19</sup>, and 2002.<sup>15</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Approximately 60% 
  of cases reported in Brazil are related to any category of sexual contact, and 
  almost half (42.9%) of them are due to men having unprotected sex with men. 
  This group accounted for the majority of cases in the first years of the epidemic. 
  Then AIDS has disseminated among intravenous drug users and those receiving 
  blood transfusions and/or blood products. From mid 1990's of the 20<sup>th</sup> 
  century, the epidemic has spread among heterosexuals, which now comprise the 
  sexual exposure subcategory with higher number of reported disease cases. Consequently, 
  HIV/AIDS incidence has rapidly increased among women and men:women ratio has 
  been reduced from 18.9:1 in 1984 to 1.5:1 in 2004, reaching 0.9:1 in the 13-19 
  years age group (adolescents) in 2006. It is estimated 16,410 (0.4%) infected 
  pregnant women aging between 15 and 34 years.<sup>20</sup> Mother-to-infant 
  transmission has been decreasing nationwide: from 16% in 1997<sup>21</sup> to 
  7.8% in 2001 and 3.7% in 2002 but showing regional differences.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increasing incidence rates have been seen among those
population segments with lower schooling and lower socioeconomic
condition. The same has been observed among those living in urban
areas with less than 50,000 inhabitants.<sup>5,6,15</sup> The
epidemic behavior seems to be evidencing social and gender
inequalities in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In regard to mortality, the cumulative deaths for the period
1980-2004 were 171,923. Mortality rates among men were higher in
1995 (15.1 per 100,000 inhabitants) and then they decreased to
lower rates of around 8.8 per 100,000. Mortality rates among
women have remained steady, around 4.0 per 100,000 throughout the
time series. The highest rates were seen in 1996, 4.8 per
100,000.<sup>11</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Antiretroviral 
  Therapy Program covered 160,000 people in 2004. The estimated coverage was 170,000 
  people in 2005, including all HIV/AIDS cases requiring drug therapy, those at 
  risk of HIV exposure due to occupational injuries, and newborns of HIV-infected 
  mothers.<sup>12</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was possible 
  to indirectly measure the impact of antiretroviral therapy use on the epidemic 
  using indicators such as hospital admission rates, outpatient care, and emergency 
  room and day hospital visits.<sup>8</sup> Interestingly, the proportion of AIDS 
  hospital admissions in SUS remained the same over time. However, lower admission 
  rates have been reported among HAART patients in healthcare services. Parallel 
  to that, between 1997 and 2003, there was a 2.7 increase in those receiving 
  HAART (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>AIDS epidemic trends in five Brazilian regions</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some studies<sup>2,20</sup> 
  have pointed out temporal changes in AIDS epidemic in Brazil showing a trend 
  toward the stabilization of incidence rates, starting mostly from 1997 after 
  the introduction of universal HAART. However, the epidemic slowdown has not 
  been consistent all over Brazil. Brito et al<sup>2</sup> assessed regional patterns 
  of AIDS progress and verified a trend toward stabilization and slowdown mostly 
  in S&atilde;o Paulo (Southeastern region), whereas increasing rates were still 
  seen in the Northeastern region.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study of time 
  progress of AIDS cases in the period between 1990 and 2002 and deaths occurring 
  two years after disease diagnosis was possible through comparative analysis 
  of incidence and mortality rates. HIV/AIDS incidence and mortality rates have 
  increased steadily and consistently in different Brazilian regions up to mid 
  1990's. However, there has been gradual decrease in mortality since 1996, and 
  increasing incidence rates have no more been associated with increasing deaths. 
  Moreover, in the Southeastern region, incidence rates seem to have decreased 
  as well since 1998 to a lower level than mortality with a slight breakout again 
  in 2002 (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29423f2.gif">Figure 2</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The temporal trend 
  analysis of HIV/AIDS incidence and mortality by gender for the same period showed 
  different trends. Incidence rates among men have slowed down since 1999 with 
  slight growth in 2002, while among women there has not been clear evidence of 
  slowing down. A case series analysis by regions subsequently to 2002 could better 
  indicate these trends. Mortality rates by gender have showed a more significant 
  reduction among men since 1997 but this trend has been toward stabilization 
  in both men and women in the following years (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29423f3.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A comparison between 
  observed and expected cases for the period 1990-2003 found expected incidence 
  rates higher than those observed in all regions, except in the Northern region, 
  in the last years of this time series. But differences between means (case incidence) 
  of observed and expected rates were only statistically significant in the Southeastern 
  and Midwestern regions. These differences have been evidenced in these regions 
  as early as 1999, while they have become evident &#150; though much less evident 
  &#150; in the Northern region only since 2000. These differences have also become 
  noticeable in the Northeastern region since 2000 and in the Southern region 
  since 2001 (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29423f4.gif">Figure 4</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HIV surveillance in Brazil</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A report of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS)<sup>13</sup> called "Second generation HIV surveillance:
the next decade" proposes that national and subnational systems
of epidemiological surveillance (ES) for HIV/AIDS mainly focus on
recovering the view of ES as a valuable source of information for
health actions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This document presents the would-be principles of these new
"second generation surveillance systems" for
HIV/AIDS.<sup>10</sup> The first two principles recommend that ES
systems should be adjusted to the epidemic trend to be able to
monitor changes in the HIV infection dynamics. The third and
fourth principles refer to the need of ES to focus on both HIV
risk behaviors and HIV infection, targeting those populations at
higher risk of getting infected, developing the disease or dying
from any HIV-related opportunistic disease. The goal is to detect
HIV infection at earlier stages using behavioral studies to
better understand the HIV/AIDS epidemiology. The fifth principle
of the "Second Generation Surveillance" report suggests the
potential use of data from other information sources<i>.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the fifth principle, a ES is expected to be able to
track observed changes focused on HIV risk behaviors and HIV
infection, targeting the most vulnerable populations. This
"second generation surveillance" can be accomplished in Brazil by
properly and consistently gathering together several information
sources. This could be made through the assessment and link of
national databases, such as SINAN, SIM, Drug Logistics Management
System (SICLOM), and Laboratory Testing Control System (SISCEL).
Besides, periodical population-based surveys and sentinel
surveillance (surveillance of sentinel groups and events through
sentinel network) could provide additional data on HIV/AIDS
epidemiology.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HIV/AIDS surveillance in Brazil now consists of universal
reporting of AIDS cases, surveillance of sentinel populations
(STD outpatient clinics and pregnant women in labor), HIV
serological status and/or behavioral studies targeting specific
populations and surveillance in testing and counseling centers
(CTA).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the first 20 years of epidemic (1980-2000) the main ES
strategy was universal compulsory AIDS case reporting. AIDS was
included in the listing of compulsory case reporting in December
22, 1986 (Ministry of Health's Administrative Decree n. 542) and
universal compulsory reporting of HIV-positive pregnant women and
HIV exposed children is established by the Ministry of Health's
Administrative Rule n. 993/2000.<sup>11</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1992, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has been carrying
out surveillance of sentinel groups and repeated behavioral and
cross-sectional studies of HIV infection prevalence among target
populations such as pregnant women attending prenatal care and
STD clinics, Army draftees, and SUS pregnant women in labor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some studies, like 
  the 1998 sentinel study on pregnant women in labor modified from 2000 to comprise 
  a representative sample of pregnant women,<sup>15</sup> have allowed estimating 
  HIV prevalence at different time points of the epidemic (<a href="#tab1">Table</a>). 
  It can be noted very similar estimates around 0.6% for cross-section studies 
  conducted in 1998,<sup>18</sup> 2000<sup>19</sup> and 2004,<sup>15</sup> which 
  suggests likely stabilization of the epidemic.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29423t1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study comprising 
  8,002 pregnant women attending prenatal care in CTAs of 27 municipalities in 
  Southern Brazil, based on data from CTA Information System (SI-CTA), estimated 
  0.5% HIV prevalence and 0.3%-0.6% 95% confidence interval in this population. 
  The study database comprised 25% minimum coverage of pregnant women for 2003. 
  The variable associated to higher prevalence rates was lower schooling.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A major study commissioned by the PN-DST/AIDS, opening up the
dichotomy between HIV surveillance and sexual behavior
information, was carried out among Brazilian Army draftees in
1998. HIV prevalences of 0.19%, 0.12% and 0.08% were estimated
for Northern/Midwestern and Southern regions and the states of
Rio de Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo, respectively. Lower
schooling was also found to be associated to higher risk sexual
behavior. The Northern and Midwestern regions showed the lowest
socioeconomic indicators among draftees.<sup>17</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also concerning 
  behavioral surveillance, a 2003 study conducted by the Ministry of Health<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
  in a representative sample of Brazilian population aged 14 years and over who 
  were sexually active in the previous six months found that 28% had been HIV 
  tested at least once before. The testing proportion varied by age groups: 22.5% 
  in those aged 15-24 years, 36.4% in 25-39 years, and 21.3% in 40-54 years. Socioeconomic 
  condition was once more associated to HIV status awareness. According to social 
  strata used in the study, lower testing rates were seen among both men (13.7%) 
  and women (28.35) in D/E strata. In A/B strata, 36.1% men and 43.4% women had 
  been tested. HIV testing rates among pregnant women were 51.5% in 2002 and 57.4% 
  in 2003.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Understanding the observed trends has been complicated by the
different stages and profiles of AIDS epidemic in Brazil. When
analyzed by regions, the epidemic showed a mixed trend:
increasing incidence rates in most regions but declining rates in
the Southeastern region. Mortality rates have generally decreased
but this decrease is only statistically significant in the
Southeastern region. Women mortality rates have significantly
increased in the Northern, Northeastern, and Southern regions.
There are several assumptions to explain these scenarios in
Brazil and there is a need for further studies specifically
focusing on socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral aspects,
as well as at biological markers for circulating HIV viruses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evidence gathered must be examined comparatively taking into
consideration their incompleteness and other limitations of
information sources. At the time of data analysis (November
2005), the AIDS database available showed information
inconsistencies from 2003. In an attempt to address case
underreporting, the PN-DST/AIDS joined together different
databases, which allowed to recovering hundreds of new cases by
state. However, as the unified database has not yet been properly
checked there are duplicated cases for the year 2004. This has
impaired the analysis of major variables such as schooling, which
significantly lost consistency after databases were joined
together.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increasing AIDS 
  cases in several Brazilian regions can be partially explained by services response. 
  There are still AIDS cases that have late access to health services and have 
  limited chances of benefiting from adequate therapy. A study by Brito et al<sup>2</sup> 
  carried out in a Northeastern state showed that about half of HAART users only 
  got to know their HIV status at the time they are hospitalized due to clinical 
  manifestations of immunodeficiency. In addition, those who did not know their 
  HIV status were 50% more likely to present symptoms at their first visit to 
  a specialized service compared to those who did it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key elements for understanding differences in the epidemic
trends by regions are the following: epidemic course, coverage of
prevention actions, people's knowledge on HIV/AIDS, level of
schooling and other socioeconomic factors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Universal access 
  to antiretroviral therapy, which impact on mortality and survival rates has 
  been well documented, would not be enough to explain declining rates over time. 
  Indicators of behavior changes, such as considerable increase (178%) of condom 
  sales in the period 1995-2004, may not have yet exerted an impact on the number 
  of AIDS cases as they are usually a late manifestation of the infection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stabilization of infection prevalence can be explained by
other factors, such as increased mortality and/or reduced
survival. To monitor HIV prevalence, studies should be conducted
to further the analyses and better understand HIV trends and
survival and AIDS mortality taking into account the observed gaps
between different regions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is also a need to carefully review HIV surveillance in
Brazil. Data is still scarce to assess whether initiatives such
as awareness campaigns like "<i>Fique sabendo</i>" (You showed
know), and the implementation of 329 CTAs and quick HIV testing
in the Northern region among others, have effectively expanded
access to HIV testing to most vulnerable populations in different
regions of Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is proposed that second generation HIV surveillance be
implemented linking HIV serological diagnosis, AIDS surveillance,
and risk behavior data. Also, sentinel surveillance studies
should be designed to allow estimating HIV infection by region
and in particular cases of greater vulnerability such as border
areas and large population concentration areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although trend curves stratified by schooling were not
presented here, there is well documented evidence of the
so-called "epidemic pauperization".<sup>5,6</sup> A national
program for HIV/AIDS management should develop specific actions
targeting population segments living in poverty and reflect the
different epidemics in the different regions requiring specific
individual responses.</font></p>
