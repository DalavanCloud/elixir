<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b>    Previous experiments showed that caffeine blocks 
the development of <i>Aedes    aegypti</i> (<i>Diptera</i>, <i>Culicidae</i>) 
in the larval stage, consequently    inhibiting the production of adults. This 
study aimed at obtaining data suggestive    of caffeine resistance by these 
mosquitoes.    
<br>   <b>METHODS:</b> Experiments were carried out in successive generations 
to assess    adult production from eggs laid in previous generation and 
oviposition rate    in every generation using 200 and 500 &#181;g/mL caffeine. 
Tap water was used    as control. Experiments were conducted in the city of 
S&atilde;o Jos&eacute;    do Rio Preto, Southeastern Brazil between 2002 and 
2005. Statistical tests consisted    of exploratory data analysis and 
smoothing algorithms.    
<br>   <b>RESULTS:</b> Increasing reduction in productivity of adults occurred 
among    generations at both caffeine concentrations but the differences were 
only significant    at 200&#181;g/mL caffeine. As for the oviposition rate, 
there was a decrease    in the mean number of eggs per female over generations 
at both caffeine concentrations.    
<br>   <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b>    There was no evidence of caffeine resistance 
over generations. The study results    corroborate caffeine as an alternative 
as an important <i>Ae. Aegypti</i> control    agent to avoid 
resistance.</font></p>

size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are at 
least 447 species of insects and mites reported as having developed resistance 
to one or more chemical and/or organic groups in literature. Multiresistant 
species showing several mechanisms of resistance to different chemical groups 
are common. Resistance is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as 
"the development, in an organism, of the capacity to tolerate doses of toxics 
that are lethal for the majority of the individuals in a normal population 
(considered susceptible) of the same species" (WHO, 1957 <i>apud</i> 
Scott,<sup>9</sup> 1995). The development of alterations in the susceptibility 
of a population to toxics is due to specific selection of pre-adapted 
individuals over several generations of exposure (Scott,<sup>9</sup> 
1995).</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The level of 
resistance in populations of vector insects such as <i>Aedes aegypti</i> is 
dependent on the volume and frequency of insecticides applied. The rapid 
development of resistance in mosquitoes is favored by some characteristics 
including their short life cycle (11 to 18 days at 26ºC for <i>Ae. 
aegypti,</i>) and abundant progeny (about 70 to 150 eggs are laid per 
<i>Aedes</i> female) (Georghiou &amp; Taylor,<sup>2</sup> 1977; Hemingway 
&amp; Ranson,<sup>3</sup> 2000).</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Aedes 
aegypti</i> is among insects of medical interest as it is a vector of human 
disease viruses, including dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever. 
Currently, the main <i>Ae. aegypti</i> control agents are pyrethroids and 
organophosphorous insecticides. However, the most used insecticides are mainly 
organophosphates, which are also highly toxic for vertebrates, even in 
relatively small doses. In addition, they are chemically unstable and require 
new applications at short intervals. Resistance to insecticides has already 
been detected in <i>Ae. aegypti</i> in several parts of the world, including 
Brazil. The city of S&atilde;o Jos&eacute; do Rio Preto, Southeastern Brazil, 
has been subjected to intensive chemical control over the years but <i>Aedes 
aegypti</i> has shown reduced susceptibility (Macoris et al,<sup>7</sup> 1999; 
Macoris et al,<sup>8</sup> 2003).</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Caffeine (CAF 
&#150; 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine; 
C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ) is a natural component 
of coffee, tea, guarana and chocolate. It has been used in successive research 
projects aimed at using it as an auxiliary agent in the control of <i>Ae. 
aegypti</i>. CAF showed the capacity to block larval development of these 
mosquitoes, causing their death at this stage (Laranja et al,<sup>6</sup> 
2003).</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present 
study aimed at obtaining information suggestive of the development of <i>Ae. 
aegypti</i> resistance to CAF. Adult production from eggs and oviposition rate 
were studied over generations.</font></p>      
<p>&nbsp;</p>     
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Aedes 
Aegypti</i> eggs, larvae and pupae (Diptera: Culicidae) were collected at 
breeding sites in the city of S&atilde;o Jos&eacute; do Rio Preto, State of 
S&atilde;o Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, between 2002 and 2005. They were grown 
in the laboratory, producing the eggs for the study 
experiments.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The experiments 
involved treatment of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> at two different CAF concentrations: 
200 and 500 mg/mL. These concentrations were chosen based on previous data 
showing weak and strong effect on larval mortality, respectively (Laranja et 
al,<sup>6</sup> 2003). At each concentration, eggs were allowed to develop in 
a 500 mL aqueous CAF solution. Adults of every generation were put into a cage 
and their eggs were used to produce the next generation in a medium with the 
same CAF concentration. In the experiment with 200 mg/mL CAF solution, 200 
eggs laid in the previous generation gave rise to the next one, while in the 
treatment with 500 mg/mL CAF the number of eggs in the treated tests had to be 
increased because, as mentioned before, mosquitoes are strongly affected at 
this concentration (Laranja et al,<sup>8</sup> 2003). In both experiments, tap 
water was used as control.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When larvae 
reached L3 instar, 0.08 g of fish food was added to the medium. At pupal 
stage, they were transferred to cages to develop into adults. Adults were fed 
with an 8% aqueous sugar solution. Females were blood fed (required for oocyte 
maturation) once a week using an immobilized mouse placed inside the cages for 
about 1.5 hour each time.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eggs were laid 
on a filter paper strip placed inside a half-filled water glass at the level 
of water surface. Glasses (tumblers) containing a cone of filter paper and 
filled with water were also put inside the cages to increase relative air 
humidity. The filter paper containing eggs was removed two to three times a 
week (depending on the presence of eggs). Eggs were counted, dried for 24 
hours and used (up to 30 days) to produce the next generation.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statistical 
tests involved exploratory data analysis and smoothing algorithms for 
proportions of adults produced in each new generation (Resistant Smooth &#150; 
Velleman,<sup>10</sup> 1980; Velleman &amp; Hoaglin,<sup>11</sup> 1981). 
Z-test for two proportions comparison and polynomial regression statistics to 
adjust smooth data on adult production over generations in Experiment I 
(treatment with 200 mg/mL CAF solution) were also used (Zar,<sup>12</sup> 
1999).</font></p>      
<p>&nbsp;</p>     
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The number 
and    proportion of male and female adults produced from eggs and the number 
of eggs    laid in each generation up to the last female died or adult 
production ceased    for both experiments are shown in <a 
href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/22t1.gif">Table 1</a>. Environment    
characteristics for the development of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> such as room 
temperature    and humidity of growth media during the experiments are shown 
in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40n6/22t2.gif">Table    2</a>.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Experiment I 
was interrupted in the 10<sup>th</sup> generation due to the fact that nineth 
generation eggs were unable to develop into adults. In this generation, the 
control experiment produced only three females and four males, while the 
treated test, prepared with a total of 189 eggs obtained in F8, did not 
produce any adults.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
productivity of adults from 200 eggs, used to start each new generation in 
Experiment I, was variable for both the treated and control experiments in the 
different generations. In the control generations, the productivity ranged 
between 11% and 63.5% and in the treated generations, it ranged between 3.2% 
and 52%.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In light of the 
numbers, the productivity of adults was higher in the control than in the 
treatment tests in five generations (F2, F3, F5, F6 and F8). In F0 and F4, the 
productivity of adults in the control and treated experiments was equivalent, 
and in F1 and F7, the productivity of adults in CAF 200 was higher than in the 
control. The highest proportion of adults was obtained in F2 for both control 
and treatment tests. However, in the treatment of F5 generation the initial 
number of eggs (produced in F4) had to be increased to 500 in order to obtain 
enough adults able to produce eggs to begin a new generation.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Experiment II 
(treatment with 500 mg/mL CAF) was carried out similarly to experiment I, only 
at a different CAF concentration. This experiment lasted up to the seventh 
generation because the eggs of the treated produced only few adult females 
(and males were not produced). The number of eggs starting each new generation 
was variable due to low productivity of adults in the treated (i.e., high 
larval mortality rate) and low egg laying capacity of females produced at this 
CAF concentration.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charts 
including    the proportion and smooth proportion of adults versus generation 
for Experiments    I and II are shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. The 
different levels of    the lines corresponding to control and treatment in the 
proportion charts (<a href="#fig1">Figure1A</a>    and <a 
href="#fig1c">1C</a>) reflect larval mortality due to CAF effect. However,    
using the test of two independent proportions and normal approximation, the    
results showed no significant difference between treatment and control in 
every    generation for both experiments.</font></p>     
<p><a name="fig1"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to the 
difference of productivity of adults between generations, the values for 
treatment and control were not significant in Experiment II. For example, the 
highest difference of smooth proportions was obtained between F0 and F1 in the 
treatment (0.03; Z=0.50, p=0.31) as well as in the control (0.03; Z=0.28, 
p=0.39), indicating that the productivity of adults remained the same along 
generations. However, in Experiment I, there was a decreasing trend of adult 
productivity over generations in the treatment and in the control . The model 
of polynomial regression grade 2 adjusted to data showed statistic 
significance for differences between generations. Considering Y= productivity 
of adults and X= generation, the resulting quadratic regression equation for 
control is:</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2">Y=0.19+0.05X&#150;0.006X<sup>2</sup>; R<sup>2</sup>=82.1%, F=16.03, 
p=0.002;</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and for the 
treatment is:</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="2">Y=0.21+0.04X&#150;0.007X<sup>2</sup>; R<sup>2</sup>=99.7%, F=1129.0, 
p=0.000.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An additional 
observation    in plots of <a href="#fig1">Figure 1 A</a>, <a 
href="#fig1c">C</a> (Experiments    I and II, respectively) is the alternated 
increase and decrease of adult production    in the successive generations. 
Such variation occurred simultaneously in the    treatment and control 
tests.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Experiment 
I, the total productivity of eggs in F1 was higher in the treatment than in 
the control tests. From F1 onwards, the treated tests produced a total number 
of eggs much lower than controls. Such difference was greater from F4 to F8, 
and egg production in the treated of F8 was 97% lower than in the control. 
Mean egg productivity per female in F0 and F3 was higher in the treatment but, 
in the remaining generations, this mean was higher in the control. In the 
three last generations (F6, F7 and F8), oviposition rate per female in the 
control exceeded the treated by 72%, 90% and 78%, 
respectively.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Experiment 
II, the total number of eggs and mean egg productivity per female were also 
lower in the treatment tests. In the control, the total number of eggs ranged 
from 412 to 3,001, and in the treatment, from 0 to 692, while the number of 
eggs per female varied from 68 to 222.2 in the control, and from 9.9 to 134.2 
in the treatments.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charts of 
productivity    of eggs are shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> for both 
experiments and tests.    Although statistical tests could not be applied in 
this case, the greater differences    between control and treatment in each 
new generation (for Experiments I and    II) and between generations (mainly 
for Experiment I) are adequate to evaluate    the results.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because the 
development of resistance to insecticides is one of the greatest problems 
affecting the success of vector control programs, it is also important to 
obtain information concerning resistance to possible alternative control 
agents. Bti, produced from toxins of <i>Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. 
israelensis</i>, which is currently the most widely used alternative control 
agent, has already showed resistance in some sites (Ffrench-Constant et 
al,<sup>1</sup> 2004). Caffeine (CAF), which was previously used in biological 
tests with <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, confirmed its efficacy as an auxiliary agent in 
the mosquito control. It blocks mosquito development at larval stage, 
inhibiting the production of adults at variable percentages, depending on CAF 
concentration used (Laranja et al,<sup>6</sup> 2003).</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to the 
productivity    of adults in each new generation, statistical tests showed no 
significant difference    between treatment and control in both Experiments 
but showed significantly reduced    productivity in the tests of Experiment I 
as the generations progressed. Differences    between generations seen in 
Experiment II were not significant. The fact that    treatment and control 
tests remain constant or similarly decreased throughout    generations shows 
that CAF is not promoting resistance detectable by production    of adults. It 
is remarkable the occurrence of alternated decrease and increase    of adult 
productivity in successive generations observed in the charts of <a 
href="#fig1">Figure    1A</a>, <a href="#fig1c">C</a>, for treated and control 
tests. This observation    needs further study.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the 
production of adults in the treated and control tests have shown a 
statistically significant tendency to remain the same or to decrease as the 
generations progressed, the number of eggs laid in each new generation was 
differently affected in treatment tests when compared with the control tests. 
Although statistical tests could not be applied in the analysis of this 
characteristic, the differences are considerable, showing a reduction up to 
90% in the mean number of eggs per female when compared with the controls, 
especially in the most recent generations. This suggests that, instead of 
promoting resistance, the impaired effect of CAF increases in succeeding 
generations.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Temperature and 
humidity do not seem to have affected the study results. Mosquito generations 
produced under established conditions showed different results (for example, 
in the experiment using CAF 200 temperature and humidity in the F4 generation 
were the same as those in F8 but adult productivity and oviposition rate were 
different). Besides, in several cases, control and treated tests in the same 
generation (consequently in the same environment conditions) also yielded 
different results.</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the 
possibility that CAF can promote an increase in insect resistance over time in 
nature could not be discarded, the present results obtained in laboratory did 
not corroborate this assumption. CAF increasingly affected the production of 
adult descendants and oviposition rate in successive generations, a finding 
corroborating those obtained by Itoyama et al<sup>5</sup> (1998) in 
<i>Drosophila prosaltans</i>. In this organism, progeny productivity studied 
over 10 generations decreased in a dosage-dependent manner in every 
generation. At lower doses, the normal productivity of progeny was recovered 
when treatment was stopped but not at the highest doses used. In addition, 
tests aimed at studying the egg-laying capacity of <i>D. prosaltans</i> grown 
in a control culture medium and media containing CAF showed that this 
characteristic also decreased according to the CAF concentration used, from 
22% at 50 mg/mL to 87% at 1,500 mg/mL (Itoyama &amp; Bicudo,<sup>4</sup> 
1992).</font></p>      
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Previous and 
present data on effect of caffeine treatment may recommend this agent as an 
alternative control of <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.</font></p>
