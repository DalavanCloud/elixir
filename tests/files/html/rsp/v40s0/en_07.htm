<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Items from the 
  UNGASS Draft Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (2001) are analyzed. The 
  Brazilian experience of new methods for testing and counseling among vulnerable 
  populations, preventive methods controlled by women, prevention, psychosocial 
  support for people living with HIV/AIDS, and mother-child transmission, is discussed. 
  These items were put into operation in the form of keywords, in systematic searches 
  within the standard biomedicine databases, also including the subdivisions of 
  the Web of Science relating to natural and social sciences. The Brazilian experience 
  relating to testing and counseling strategies has been consolidated through 
  the utilization of algorithms aimed at estimating incidence rates and identifying 
  recently infected individuals, testing and counseling for pregnant women, and 
  application of quick tests. The introduction of alternative methods and new 
  technologies for collecting data from vulnerable populations has been allowing 
  speedy monitoring of the epidemic. Psychosocial support assessments for people 
  living with HIV/AIDS have gained impetus in Brazil, probably as a result of 
  increased survival and quality of life among these individuals. Substantial 
  advances in controlling mother-child transmission have been observed. This is 
  one of the most important victories within the field of HIV/AIDS in Brazil, 
  but deficiencies in prenatal care still constitute a challenge. With regard 
  to prevention methods for women, Brazil has only shown a shy response. Widespread 
  implementation of new technologies for data gathering and management depends 
  on investments in infrastructure and professional skills acquisition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present work complements the approach developed in a
previous paper<sup>7</sup> that analyzed certain items from the
base document of the United Nations General Assembly Special
Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS) giving targets for Science,
Technology and Innovation relating to HIV/AIDS. The objective of
the present paper was to discuss the Brazilian experience of new
testing methods and counseling for particularly vulnerable
populations (for instance, pregnant women); new technologies for
data capture and management, especially regarding injectable
drugs users; and multicenter studies. Publications on female
preventive methods (microbicides and female condoms), prevention
and psychosocial support for people living with HIV/AIDS and
measures aimed at controlling mother-child HIV transmission were
also assessed.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODOLOGICAL 
  PROCEDURES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As detailed in 
  the previous paper,<sup>7</sup> the items listed were worked on as key words 
  in systematic searches in standard biomedicine databases (MEDLINE and SciELO), 
  and also included the Web of Science, in its subdivisions relating to Natural 
  Sciences (SCI-Expanded) and Social Sciences (SSCI). Further details regarding 
  the methodology and procedures utilized here can be found in the abovementioned 
  article.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>TESTING AND 
  COUNSELING</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil has now accumulated wide-ranging experience in
counseling and testing for HIV/AIDS, although very little of the
knowledge initially acquired has been translated into <i>stricto
sensu</i> papers<i>.</i> This is probably because of the pressure
arising from the significant demand and the immediate need to
provide an extensive infrastructure network of counseling and
testing units. Professional training in the use of laboratory
techniques was provided, as was training in the procedures needed
for counseling, with capacitation relating to the ethical
principles of respect for individuals' desire to be tested (or
not) and protection of their confidentiality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, over recent years, the Brazilian experience
relating to new testing and counseling strategies has been
consolidating in three areas: 1) use of testing algorithms with
sensitive/less sensitive tests, with the aims of assessing the
incidence of infection and identifying recently infected
individuals; 2) testing and counseling for pregnant women; and 3)
assessment and application of fast tests in different
populations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian experience is very consistent with regard to
estimating the incidence of infection and identifying recently
infected individuals by means of testing algorithms that use
sensitive and less sensitive tests. Originally called 'detuned
assays' and more recently named the "STAHRS algorithm", this
method has been applied to projects that recruit large samples
coming from clinics<sup>1,24,34</sup> or that form part of
preparatory studies for behavioral and/or vaccinal
interventions.<sup>6</sup> Some studies have been using this
methodology for dealing with more unapproachable populations,
such as drug users.<sup>27,68,72</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the light of the success of the protocol for the AIDS
Clinical Trials Group, study 076 (ACTG 076), and subsequent
developments in the prevention of mother-child HIV transmission,
such prevention has today become an absolute priority in all
countries. This protocol aims at making the strategies for
testing, counseling and fast intervention as systematic and
wide-ranging as possible. The objective is to reduce and, if
possible, eliminate mother-child HIV transmission. From this
perspective, it highlights the need to incorporate, maintain and
test the greatest number of pregnant women possible within the
context of regular antenatal care and, failing this, to use fast
tests with the aim of providing backing for immediate
intervention for women and babies around the time of birth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study by Marques et al<sup>41</sup> (2002) identified
deficiencies in the field of testing for HIV and counseling of
pregnant women in reference centers in S&atilde;o Paulo.
Subsequent studies, such as the study by Goldani et
al<sup>26</sup> (2003), carried out in Porto Alegre, showed
improvements in the patterns of testing and counseling in
antenatal services, though there were differences between social
classes, to the detriment of the less favored segments of the
population. Further assessments, like the nationwide study by
Souza Jr. et al<sup>66</sup> (2004), corroborated the regional
findings of Goldani et al.<sup>26</sup> Both of these studies
indicated class-related differences, with deficient coverage for
the detection of HIV infection in women from poorer backgrounds,
in addition to the regional differential, to the detriment of the
poorer and less industrialized regions of the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of the deficiencies in testing and counseling for
HIV/AIDS among pregnant women, different clinics have been
implementing the strategy of using fast tests and immediate
intervention among women who do not know their serological status
until just before labor and delivery. The study by Nogueira et
al<sup>50</sup> (2001) documents the successful implementation of
a strategy consisting of fast testing, immediate counseling and
intervention in a reference maternity hospital in Rio de
Janeiro.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently, systematic assessments of different types of
fast tests<sup>21</sup> have been started, with the aim of
subsequent application not only to pregnant women but also to a
variety of vulnerable and/or unapproachable populations.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS CONTROLLED 
  BY WOMEN AND MICROBICIDES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of vaginal microbicides for preventing the
transmission of HIV and other STDs received a hard blow with the
publication<sup>73</sup> of results from a clinical trial that
assessed COL-1492, a gel based on nonoxynol-9. There have only
been a few times in the history of interventions against HIV/AIDS
that a strategy has been shown not only to be ineffective but
also harmful if used improperly. Unfortunately, such improper
conditions were very similar to the usual conditions observed in
female populations under particular risk, such as sex
professionals. Such findings drew attention to the possible
harmful consequences of interventions in the field of
microbicides and started a series of debates on the ethics of
certain field studies on HIV/AIDS. In a particularly unfortunate
coincidence, these findings came to light at the same time as
some studies on mother-child HIV transmission in the sub-Saharan
region of Africa with questionable ethical standards were being
implemented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the recent history of studies on microbicides has gone
through its days of purgatory and, since then, there has been an
oscillation between the essential need for such development and
the difficulties in practical evaluation of such strategies
through protocols that combine scientific consistency with
respect for ethical principles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a lack of Brazilian indexed literature in the
international databases, with regard to new perspectives for
substantial intervention using microbicides in human populations.
The exception to this is in articles within the field of
chemistry giving in vitro assessments of substance with
antiretroviral and microbicide properties,<sup>4,55</sup> and a
series of papers on behavioral characteristics that are
potentially linked to the adoption of vaginal microbicides for
preventing HIV/AIDS and other STDs.<sup>28,29</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil urgently needs to participate in the present debate on
new alternatives for microbicides, and the good intentions of
activists and researchers need to be transformed into effective
protocols.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazilian publications on the female condom are equally rare
in the indexed literature, although published data is frequently
found in leaflets such as those issued by Family Health
International, and therefore outside of the scope of the present
review.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study by Warren &amp; Philpott<sup>75</sup> (2003) reviewed
the inclusion of female condoms in the public policies of a large
number of countries, including Brazil. A recent paper by Vieira
et al<sup>74</sup> (2004) assessed the acceptability of male and
female condoms according to women living with HIV/AIDS who were
participating in an intervention project. This paper identified
levels of acceptance of female condoms among women living with
HIV/AIDS that were all in respects similar to their acceptance
among women who were not infected by HIV.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A community intervention with the objective of reducing the
vulnerability of women to STD/AIDS in S&atilde;o Paulo showed
good acceptance and demand for female condoms in the
community.<sup>22</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the abovementioned publications, Brazil's
participation in the world debate on the role of female condoms
for the prevention of HIV/AIDS is still modest, in the context of
indexed publications.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DATA CAPTURE 
  AND MANAGEMENT REGARDING HIV/AIDS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil's introduction into international protocols with wide
coverage and complexity has led some centers of excellence to
successfully implement modern methods of data collection, entry
and management, instead of the traditional methods of manual
digitization and assessment of the information collected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Basically, the gains obtained can be divided along three
lines. Firstly, some clinics have introduced strategies for data
capture from visual information and analog-digital processing,
followed by assessment and entry of the information into standard
format digital databases. For example, this has been done through
bringing into operation systems that utilize analog-digital
conversion and are capable of processing immense volumes of data
quickly, with small margins of error. In some data processing
centers, such operations run in real time: the effective data
entry in the database occurs practically simultaneously with its
collection. This allows for almost immediate generation (via
programming tools) of procedures and/or assessment reports on the
digitized data. Likewise, other strategies for non-visual data
capture have also been shown to be useful within systems with
fast entry and immediate assessment of the information collected,
such as the use of web-based resources like "remote capture"
systems, for example.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Technicalities 
  aside, such modern resources for data management have been making it possible 
  to answer basic questions within the field of multicenter studies that form 
  part of regional and national databases. At the same time, access to antiretroviral 
  drugs has been substantially expanding in developing countries. Although the 
  expansion has been much less than foreseen by the World Health Organization/United 
  Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (OMS/UNAIDS) (as stated in the aims of the 
  "3 by 5" program<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>), it is 
  relevant in that detailed and continuous monitoring has been required on a large 
  scale and over a short timeframe. A recent study from a international research 
  group that includes researchers from two Brazilian centers, attests to the need 
  and factorability of such initiatives.<sup>14</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, alternative methods for data collection are being
introduced among particularly vulnerable populations such as
injectable drug users, among whom technical questions and the
ethics of collecting and managing potentially embarrassing,
stigmatizing and even incriminating questions are a
challenge.<sup>63</sup> Recently, with support from the Ministry
of Health and international institutes, projects using
computerized data collection techniques were implemented, with
integrated use of visual information (specially designed screens
for interactive data collection) and auditive information. This
is the Audio-Computer Assisted Interview (ACASI) method, which
has been shown to be extremely useful, with good acceptance and
consistent results.<sup>62</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The central question is no longer whether or not the
implementation of these methods is feasible. Practical experience
has shown that it is, even in non-academic units, as is the case
with the introduction of the ACASI method into treatment centers
for drug users. The question today is a matter of progressively
integrating the country into international initiatives for
expanding the access to antiretroviral medications and for
quickly and accurately monitoring side effects and resistance (if
possible, in real time). The utilization of such techniques needs
to be disseminated among health units, whether they have academic
links or not.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are also immense challenges regarding funding,
installation/renovation of infrastructure, and capacitation and
training for health professionals. However, there is no other
route towards modernity, quality and equality of access to
preventive methods and excellence in treatment.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>PREVENTION AND 
  PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The success of the so-called "Brazilian model" for HIV/AIDS
obviously does not solely consist of its innovatory program for
universal access to antiretroviral drugs. As correctly pointed
out by Berkman et al<sup>8</sup> (2005), one fundamental
dimension of the Brazilian model is its commitment to prevention.
These efforts have been especially successful because of their
wide-ranging and diversified nature with regard to application
proposals and strategies, and also because of the integrated
nature of the model, in terms of dialogue and joint action
between the State and civil society and between prevention and
treatment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To learn more from the analyses, the offer of psychosocial
support for people living with HIV/AIDS and prevention that is
said to be primary were analyzed separately. The offer of
psychosocial support is a fundamental strategy for secondary
prevention that gives rise to individual and collective results.
On the other hand, primary prevention is directed towards
uninfected people, with the aim of avoiding subsequent
infection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question of evaluating the psychosocial support has become
more prominent in recent Brazilian production, probably due to
the significant increases in the length of survival and quality
of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, there has been
pressure from funding bodies and regulatory agencies for all the
practical experiences (so far, these have been dispersed) to be
systematized. Even so, Brazilian production continues to be
erratic, with predominance of small-scale interventions that are
dispersed among different clinics and inadequately assessed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With this aim in mind, one of the lines being explored is to
assess the discordance between effective risk (translated as high
prevalence of risky behavior and/or high rates of HIV infection)
and (low) self-perception of the risk and delay (or even absence)
of demand for specific care. In these circumstances, the
opportunity to implement secondary preventive actions does not
materialize, since the individuals at effective risk and/or
already infected do not recognize that they are in this situation
and do not demand preventive actions, support and specific
care.<sup>23,65</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Insofar as people with HIV/AIDS live longer and enjoy better
quality of life, questions arise that, although not new, are
presented in a complex and challenging manner. For example, there
is the question of people living with HIV/AIDS adopting and
maintaining protected sexual practices when their partners are
serodiscordant, and also analysis of reproductive decisions by
men, women and couples. The pioneering work on this subject was
by Santos et al<sup>58</sup> (2002), which assessed the sexual
practices and reproductive decisions of women living with
HIV/AIDS. Following this work, other papers dealt with different
aspects of the sexual and reproductive health of these people,
such as the recent paper on paternity among men living with
HIV/AIDS.<sup>52</sup> There has also been a study dealing with
women's decisions in relation to their history of contraception
and interaction with their sexual partners,<sup>13</sup> and
another paper analyzing the influence of contextual variables
(the predominant medical culture in different localities) on the
reproductive decisions made by women living with
HIV/AIDS.<sup>5</sup> This last question was taken up again in a
recent study from a complementary viewpoint.<sup>31</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another dimension of primary and secondary prevention that has
still not been explored much in this country is the optimism
associated with the use of the powerful therapy of Highly Active
Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). This optimism may be translated
in carelessness in relation to personal risks (when the
individual trivializes the HIV/AIDS question from information
that is excessively optimistic regarding AIDS prognoses in the
post-HAART era). It may also lead to collective risk, when
individuals living with HIV/AIDS conclude that, because they feel
physically and/or psychologically well or have obtained favorable
results from laboratory tests, they do not have the potential for
transmitting HIV to their partners. Such optimism causes
substantial difficulties for prevention, because such individuals
would be impervious to preventive measures, which they think of
as old-fashioned and even useless. A research group at Fiocruz,
in Rio de Janeiro, has been exploring these question in
partnership with colleagues from international institutions, both
from a qualitative perspective,<sup>35</sup> and with regard to
the relativistic role of such optimism, by means of conceptual
and mathematical modeling.<sup>9,10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent paper has documented the influence of optimistic
perceptions about AIDS on risky sexual practices among men who
have sex with men (MSM), in S&atilde;o Paulo.<sup>12</sup> It is
recommended that such pioneering studies are extended to other
populations and contexts, given the central importance of this
question for prevention in the post-HAART era.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazilian scientific production is consistent with regard to
<i>stricto sensu</i> primary prevention of HIV infection, even
though it does not reflect the variety of preventive
interventions that have been developed in the country over the
last 25 years, in response to the epidemic. The reason why the
interventions that have been brought into effect have not been
mirrored in the number of publications seems to be the existence
of significant barriers between the formulation and
implementation of projects and the writing of scientific papers.
This question has recently been discussed in an editorial in the
Brazilian supplement of the journal <i>AIDS</i>.<sup>11</sup> On
the other hand, it needs to be emphasized that Brazil lacks a
culture of assessment in practically all fields of health
interventions, and the research on HIV/AIDS is therefore no
exception.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Albeit limited in extent, in relation to all other
interventions carried out, it can be highlighted that some papers
in the literature have reported on successful systematized
interventions among specific populations like drug
users,<sup>38,54</sup> migrants,<sup>36</sup> prison
populations,<sup>56</sup> female sex workers<sup>64</sup> and
dock workers.<sup>30</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several papers have dealt with prevention among young people,
giving emphasis to interventions implemented in
schools,<sup>2,3,17,39</sup> using play-based teaching
resources.<sup>59,61</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One question that Brazilian research has barely systematized
is the role of violence as a barrier to the implementation of
preventive interventions. Despite a large number of
non-systematic reports on this question, only two papers dealing
with this subject within the specific field of HIV/AIDS were
located.<sup>57,67</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recent papers have been focusing on post-exposure
prophylaxis<sup>25,60</sup> as a fundamental question. However,
these contain controversial points regarding the side effects of
the medications and their possible adverse impact on the adoption
and maintenance of safer practices. The adverse impact arises
because, in theory, individuals could always fall back on such
emergence resources, meaning that even if they were not using
regular protection, they would not be at the mercy of
circumstances.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A vigorous conceptual discussion has supported the need to
develop interventions beyond the individual and small group
level, incorporating the contextual dimension and an attempt to
transform risk contexts in a structured manner. The American
anthropologist Richard Parker is one of the proponents of this
set of strategies.<sup>53</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some initiatives based upon concepts of structural and/or
community intervention have been systematized in the recent
Brazilian literature. The work by Paiva et al<sup>51</sup> (2002)
documents the establishment of a cooperative network between
non-governmental organizations and the academic community in
S&atilde;o Paulo. Community interventions developed in
shantytowns in S&atilde;o Paulo<sup>22</sup> and Rio de
Janeiro<sup>19</sup> can also be highlighted.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>MOTHER-CHILD 
  TRANSMISSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No field of HIV/AIDS research and intervention can be compared
with the control of mother-child transmission in terms of its
efficacy and effectiveness for avoiding HIV dissemination. In the
vast majority of countries, including Brazil, the risk of HIV
transmission secondary to blood transfusion has been reduced to
nearly zero. Thus, pediatric AIDS has become practically
synonymous with mother-child transmission, with the exception of
rare cases resulting from sexual abuse of children by infected
adults, for example.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Starting with the ACTG 076 protocol and its successive
refinements and adaptations to specific contexts,<sup>71</sup>
mother-child transmission has ceased to be a strictly technical
problem. It is more related to the availability of financial
resources, infrastructure, ready offer of antiretroviral drugs
and capacitation of health professionals. In contexts where such
limitations do not exist, mother-child transmission is nearly
nonexistent, like in Europe and the United States, except in a
few specific subgroups such as women belonging to minority
groups.<sup>45</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil has advanced greatly in controlling mother-child
transmission, but there is still much to be done, since this is
an immense country with clear regional, social and health
infrastructure inequalities. While avoiding repetition of what
was stated earlier regarding the use of fast tests within the
field of mother-child transmission, the main Brazilian studies in
this field have been reviewed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first Brazilian studies relating to mother-child
transmission preceded the adoption of measures from the ACTG 076
protocol and were about the risk factors for mother-child
transmission during pregnancy, delivery period and
breast-feeding.<sup>69,70</sup> They also dealt with mathematical
modeling of the impact of the mother's infection on HIV
transmission at different times during the pregnancy, delivery
and breast-feeding.<sup>18</sup> Recent studies<sup>16</sup> have
refined previous analyses with regard to the risk factors for
mother-child HIV transmission, incorporating analyses of the
mothers' genetic-immunological profile.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the favorable results from the ACTG 076 protocol in
relation to prophylaxis for mother-child HIV transmission were
published, there has been a succession of papers documenting the
ability of Brazilian institutions to implement prophylactic
measures aimed at preventing mother-child transmission. Nogueira
et al<sup>49</sup> (2001) evaluated the implementation of an
integrated program for preventing mother-child transmission in
Rio de Janeiro.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over recent years, several successful experiences have been
reported in the literature, in different localities and
institutions. Nevertheless, structural problems and patient
retention difficulties persisted in some of the localities and
health units analyzed. By way of example, the experience obtained
at reference centers in Rio de Janeiro (RJ)<sup>32,33</sup> and
Campo Grande (MS)<sup>15</sup> can be cited; likewise, the gains
and losses in the programs for preventing mother-child
transmission in the municipalities of Goytacazes
(RJ)<sup>20</sup> and Vit&oacute;ria (ES),<sup>44</sup> and the
relative success of programs developed in Santos
(SP)<sup>48</sup> and Porto Alegre (RS).<sup>37</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the whole there have been significant gains, particularly
in reference centers and local networks that have the
infrastructure available and fast procedures for referral and
counter-referral. This makes it possible to minimize the usual
problems posed by demand surpassing the ideal for antenatal care,
patient drop-out from these clinics, and delays and deficiencies
in testing and counseling. On the other hand, when the scope of
the analysis is expanded to include municipalities that have a
precarious health structure, the deficiencies in assistance and
prevention increase greatly, although this is not in any way
exclusively in relation to HIV/AIDS control.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent update report on prevention activities developed in
S&atilde;o Paulo was encouraging: this is the richest state in
Brazil and contains the largest number of AIDS cases in the
country.<sup>42</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the fundamental components in assessing mother-child
transmission at its interface with child healthcare and
pediatrics is the correct diagnostic evaluation of infected and
non-infected children. Such evaluations cannot be done by means
of the usual serological tests, because of the presence of
maternal antibodies. Brazil has managed to successfully implement
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic technique in its
reference units. Work developed in S&atilde;o Paulo attests to
the good results from this.<sup>46,47</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the success of prevention initiatives in Brazil, the
country still has significant numbers of children living with
HIV/AIDS who need to have the benefit from recent research and
treatment findings for this particular population. Recent studies
have assessed the clinical and genotype profiles of children
followed at a reference center<sup>40</sup> and systematized the
measures needed for providing these children with an increased
survival rate and better quality of life.<sup>43</sup></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main challenge in using of new methods for testing and
counseling among particularly vulnerable populations is the
adoption of strategies for their use and for immediate
interventions among pregnant women. This is due to deficiencies
in antenatal care, which present clear differences between
regions and social classes. Nonetheless, the reduction in
mother-child transmission around the world and in Brazil today
represents one of the most important victories among the
initiatives within the field of HIV/AIDS research and
prevention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to prevention methods controlled by women, such as
female condoms and vaginal microbicides, Brazilian scientific
production is still modest, judging by the production in indexed
journals. This probably reflects, in the case of female condoms,
questions relating to the cost of their adoption (and respective
assessment) on a large scale; and in the case of microbicides,
ethical dilemmas and operational difficulties, which have been
observed all over the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New techniques for data capture and management that are
already in use in centers of excellence have enabled real-time
monitoring of the epidemic (epidemiological surveillance and
monitoring of viral resistance, among others). Nevertheless, this
initiative depends on investments in infrastructure and
professional capacitation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The advances and innovations in science and technology in
Brazil relating to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as well as the
scientific findings and the practical results, must be discussed
within a global perspective. They must allow the establishment of
parallels and contrasts in relation to initiatives being
developed within other contexts, thus broadening the assessment
of the UNGASS targets and forming the basis for comparative
evaluations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apart from the obvious differences in scale and approach
between science and technology in the United States and Europe
and in developing countries, Brazilian production can be seen to
be concentrated in "islands of excellence". There is an urgent
need to minimize the asymmetries and inequalities between the
economies and societies that are and are not players within the
field of Science, Technology and Innovation, and between the many
unequal "Brazils" that constitute our country. The objective is
not only to bring science into step with the needs of a large
proportion of the world's population, but to work towards a less
unequal and unjust world.</font></p>
