<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>Brazilian response 
  to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, 2001-2005</b></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The document from the United Nations General Assembly Special
Session (UNGASS) on HIV/Aids forms a fundamental reference point
for everyone working in this field. It encompasses a wide variety
of perspectives, from the formulation of public policies within
the national, continental and global spheres to the provision of
clinical care and implementation of preventive strategies by
governments and civil society, and last but not least it relates
to continuing dialogue with community leaders and the people who
are living with HIV and Aids.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thanks to an initiative coordinated by the Brazilian Institute
of Health, with support from the non-governmental organizations
Gestos-PE and Gapa-SP, the Ford Foundation and the National
STD/Aids Program of the Ministry of Health, it was possible to
quickly bring together a variety of researchers, activists and
managers of public programs for the prevention and treatment of
HIV/Aids, for a meeting on November 21 and 22, 2005, at the State
of S&atilde;o Paulo Department of Health, in the city of
S&atilde;o Paulo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the importance of the topic and the quality of the
contributions from the different authors, it was decided to
publish the communications presented: not in their original
format, which was very preliminary, but fully incorporating the
critiques and ideas arising from the discussions that followed
the presentation of each text at the time of holding the seminar.
It was decided, in our view correctly, to review each
contribution in detail, starting by designating editors who would
be in charge of three thematic blocks related to their respective
fields of activity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The publication resulting from this is the present supplement
of the Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica. It consists of a
compilation and analysis of essential data from the Brazilian
response to the epidemic, in consonance with the UNGASS targets
that are consolidated in the document "Declaration of Commitment
on HIV/Aids".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Editing the present supplement in step with the agenda of the
United Nations has proven to be a veritable challenge, as a
consequence both of the urgency of disseminating the information
and analyses in accordance with the scheduling of a new Assembly,
to be held between May 30 and June 2, 2006, and the extent and
complexity of the Brazilian response to the epidemic, which is
considered to be a model at the international level.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It must be emphasized here that the authors have not only
discussed topics that are central to the national and
international agenda regarding HIV/Aids, but also have had to
deal with the many subtle interrelationships between this agenda
and other public policies and their wide-ranging cultural,
scientific and community interfaces. By way of example:
protection of children and orphans, respect for and promotion of
human rights, and transversal topics such as the dialogue between
preventive education regarding HIV/Aids and general education,
HIV/Aids research in the light of national and international
dynamics in science, technology and innovation, and the friction
relating to intellectual property in the context of pandemics
with a dramatic impact on societies and particularly vulnerable
segments of the population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The targets that guided the editing of this supplement have,
in our view, been satisfactorily fulfilled, as a result of the
authors' dedication and also their relevant accumulated
experience, in the form of recollections from different
institutions and a variety of initiatives from civil society, as
well as communications in congresses, seminars and scientific
publications over the two and a half decades of continual
Brazilian response to the epidemic. Even though emphasizing the
period between UNGASS and the meeting in S&atilde;o Paulo
(2001-2005), the articles invariably deal with long-duration
trends and experiences accumulated over the last 25 years. This
also results from the fact that Brazil had already fulfilled
several of the UNGASS targets even before they were formulated in
2001. Likewise, some topics in the UNGASS declaration fortunately
do not relate to Brazil, even though they form a daily challenge
for very many communities and countries that are racked by
conflict and revolt, if not civil war.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We conclude this 
  editorial by inviting readers to share in the rich Brazilian experience that 
  has been systematized in the articles compiled here, without their critical 
  appraisal dimmed by naively triumphalistic proposals. The HIV and Aids epidemic 
  is the greatest epidemic in the whole history of humanity and, faced with this 
  immense challenge, there is no room for inertia, indifference or arrogance. 
  The observation that much has already been achieved should, rather, serve as 
  a stimulus for much more to be done, leading towards a world in which suffering 
  can be mitigated and the gap between those who have resources and those who 
  have nothing can be overcome, for the benefit of everyone's right to a dignified 
  life.</font></p>
