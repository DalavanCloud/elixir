<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study evaluates 
  the Brazilian response to the targets established by UNGASS for the prevention 
  of HIV/AIDS. The analysis was based on national research, documents and information 
  from the National Program for STD/AIDS and on state-level action plans and targets. 
  Brazil relies on various prevention policies to attain the UNGASS targets proposed 
  for 2005. These include: addressing discrimination issues, promotion of HIV 
  testing, distribution of condoms, needle exchange programs, discussion of sexuality 
  in schools, prevention initiatives for sex workers and homosexuals and prevention 
  in the workplace. These have resulted in increases in testing and condom use. 
  Various challenges are discussed, including: overcoming discontinuity in action 
  plans (particularly with more vulnerable groups), training prevention teams, 
  increasing monitoring of quantity and quality of preventative actions and overcoming 
  regional, racial and gender inequalities. It is concluded that the <i>right 
  to prevention</i> is not a priority for entities of social control, nor is it 
  on the social movement agendas. This contrasts with the <i>right to better HIV 
  treatment</i>. In order to increase the efficacy of these programs, it is suggested 
  that they be understood and incorporated based on the promotion and guarantee 
  of human rights, thereby advancing the ethical/political debate at local and 
  national levels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Universal access to free antiretroviral (ARV) medication and
HIV testing in Brazil has substantially reduced mortality and
morbidity by AIDS, including its vertical
transmission.<sup>8</sup> This is also a result of initiatives
for prompt responses to the epidemic, to combat prejudice, and
involve the general population, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), and the historically more vulnerable
groups.<sup>10,11</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although a predominantly Catholic country, sexual topics are
discussed openly in Brazilian media and school. In addition to
the distribution of millions of condoms, the government is
actively involved in STD/AIDS programs with sex workers, it
sponsors a gay pride parade in S&atilde;o Paulo (the largest in
the world) and distributes clean needles to drug users.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A critical analysis of the Brazilian response has highlighted
the importance of the integration of prevention, care and
treatment by the Brazilian Unified Health System (<i>Sistema
&Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> - SUS), with consideration to
human rights.<sup>5,9,15,21</sup> The reference to human rights
permits the analysis of vulnerability to HIV/AIDS<sup>3,20</sup>
at the individual, social and program levels with respect to the
relationships between gender and power, sexism and homophobia and
racism and poverty. These can also guide the planning,
organization and evaluation of services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this context, 
  health indicators have frequently been pointed to as indices of protection, 
  promotion or of the violation of human rights.<sup>20</sup> An example of this 
  is the incorporation of the language of human rights and of informed choice 
  in normative definitions of sexual health.<sup>16,</sup><a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  As a whole, the work in the field of rights still suffers because it is <i>ad 
  hoc</i>, single-agency and reactive, when it should be strategic, multi-agency 
  and proactive.<sup>16</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The strategic initiative 
  inaugurated in 2001 with the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS of the Special 
  Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGASS) addresses topics relating 
  health to human rights.<sup>13,26</sup> This agreement established indictors 
  and targets to be monitored by signatory countries. The present work concentrates 
  on indicators and targets number 49, 50, 52 and 53, which concern the prevention 
  of HIV/AIDS in Brazil (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29435t1.gif">Table 1</a>). The first 
  difficulty of this international effort is the ideological polarization of the 
  debate on prevention, which hampers human rights progress. Decisions are made 
  without consideration to rigorous scientific evaluation, such as the insistence 
  on "abstinence-only" policies<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  or of the dismissal of successful strategies addressing intravenous drug use.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this debate, 
  for example, defenders of abstinence propose a "just say no" policy (to drugs 
  and sex), based on values (chastity, monogamy, and "ignorance until the first 
  sexual encounter") not always shared among all citizens.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil and various 
  other countries, a second difficulty results from the lack of an established 
  forum to discuss national consensuses, theory-based action planning, definitions 
  and agreed principles.<sup>9,</sup><a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third difficulty 
  involves the need to address Brazil's health policies in the context of the 
  decentralization of the SUS, which should be undertaken in accordance with the 
  principles of completeness, equity and universality. This has been particularly 
  relevant since the creation of the Incentive Policy and of the Action and Targets 
  Plan (<i>Plano de A&ccedil;&otilde;es e Metas</i> - PAM) in 2003,<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  which were developed in conjunction with states, municipalities and NGOs.<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present work aims to evaluate the Brazilian response to
the AIDS epidemic in relation to the targets established for 2005
in the chapter concerning prevention of the "United Nations
Declaration of Commitment on HIV and AIDS".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Administrative 
  documents from the National Program for STD/AIDS (PN-DST/AIDS) of the Ministry 
  of Health, information from members of the technical team and data available 
  from the Institution's webpage<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
  were consulted to analyze the following: counseling and the availability of 
  HIV testing, sex education for young persons, access to male and female condoms, 
  control of STDs, prevention for intravenous drug users and prevention in the 
  workplace (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29435t1.gif">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also the action plans and targets for STD/AIDS for 2003 and
2004 from the states of Rio Grande do Sul, S&atilde;o Paulo,
Par&aacute;, Pernambuco and Mato Grosso do Sul were analyzed. The
criteria used in choosing these states were based in the
evaluation of the 100 municipalities with the highest incidence
of AIDS in each administrative region of Brazil according to
cases reported until 2003.<sup>7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The initiatives planned and implemented by PAM for STD/AIDS
prevention were identified and categorized in light of the
decentralization process of the SUS.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ACTION PLAN 
  AND TARGETS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The five states studied planned prevention initiatives during
2003-2004 directed to the populations considered most vulnerable
to HIV/AIDS. Conspicuous here were the state programs without a
prevention team (2/5) or with a team consisting of a single
person (1/5). The discontinuity of prevention initiatives was
notable for indigenous groups, truck drivers, rural settlers,
elderly, military personnel, and industry and company workers.
The group most cited in the allocation of resources were
adolescents attending school.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prevention initiatives 
  conducted by the states concentrate primarily on elaborating, producing and 
  distributing education material or the training of health professional that 
  work in the basic healthcare network. In relation to initiatives to increase 
  access to HIV, Syphilis and Hepatitis testing, training was offered in the basic 
  health care network and new Testing and Counseling Centers (CTA) were implemented 
  in epidemiologically strategic municipalities of Par&aacute; and Pernambuco 
  states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All states programmed 
  inter-agency initiatives that prioritized the secretariats of Education and 
  of Justice. Only in Pernambuco the partnership with Tutoring Councils was cited. 
  Despite the agenda of state coordinators indicating the incorporation of inter-agency 
  initiatives, no mention was made of activities directed to municipal health 
  or education councils in the PAM<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
  for 2003 and 2004. This suggests there is little interaction between managers 
  in the formulation, consensus and social control of health policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data on the monitoring and evaluation of initiatives at the
state level are not always available in an organized and
systematic form, thus hampering the evaluation of the STD/AIDS
management policy by the state secretariats. This suggests a
disjointed relationship exists between the production of these
data and decision-making within state STD/AIDS programs, a factor
which can reduce the effectiveness of political negotiation in
the municipalities and health councils, in inter-institutional
forums with non-health sectors and in NGOs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Access to condoms</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Policies designed 
  to increase access to male condoms in Brazil involve the allocation of financial 
  resources from national, state and municipal levels of government.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Male Condoms distribution 
  by the Brazilian government increased from 13 million in 1994 to 260 million 
  in 2003.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> The significant 
  drop in the quantity distributed by the Ministry of Health from 2004 to 2005 
  was attributed to operational problems. These include administrative and legal 
  impediments that slowed the certification process for condoms acquired from 
  international purchases (in cases where Brazilian legislation is more rigorous 
  than that of the exporting countries). It was not possible to obtain information 
  on the fulfillment of agreements of the national condom policy by state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Access to condoms 
  in Brazil has been monitored in various national studies.<sup>6,24,25,</sup><a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a> 
  These reveal an increase in the use of condoms by the population. Between 1998 
  and 2005, the use of condoms increased significantly in all age groups (<a href="#tab2">Table 
  2</a>). In research conducted in 2005, use of condom was greater among young 
  persons having completed elementary schooling and lower among women, black men 
  and in residents of the Central-Western region. The lowest rates of use continue 
  to be seen among illiterate persons.<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a></font></p>
<p><a name="tab2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29435t2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two positive initiatives coincided with the UNGASS targets:
the ongoing construction of a national condom factory in Acre
State and the distribution of four million female condoms by the
federal government in the period leading up to 2004. Brazil is
one of the principal buyers of this product in the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Concerning youths</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proportion 
  of persons below the age of 20 that use condoms increased from 47.8% in 1998 
  to 65.8% in 2005, this rate being higher among males (<a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="tab3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29435t3.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A national study 
  conducted in 2004<sup>25</sup> indicated that 57.3% of persons 15-24 years-old 
  used condoms during their last sexual encounter, 58.5% always used condoms with 
  a casual partner and 38.8% used this method with a regular partner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another study<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a> 
  indicated that 60.2% of schools in Brazil provide STD/AIDS prevention programs. 
  In high schools this represents 96.2%, in contrast to only 29.7% of elementary 
  schools undertake prevention initiatives. These percentages are reflected in 
  the proportion of teachers qualified to teach such topics: 62.4% in high schools 
  and 29.3% in elementary schools.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since August 2003, 
  the ministries of Health and of Education have advanced STD/AIDS prevention 
  initiatives, including the availability of condoms for students aged over 14.<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a> 
  The School Census indicated that 9.1% of schools made condoms available for 
  their students.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a> 
  of Municipal STD/AIDS Programs analyzed the project described above and found 
  that 67.5% of Municipal Health Secretariats allocate resources for prevention 
  in their PAM for school networks. Despite 88.4% of municipal programs addressing 
  prevention initiatives in partnership with education, the majority do not include 
  condom distribution programs to municipal schools (88.3%). The lack of human 
  resources is one of the primary reasons indicated by the program coordinators 
  for the failure to execute prevention initiatives with young persons in schools, 
  with 35% stating they do not possess the appropriate technical know-how.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The availability 
  of condoms in schools is still low in Brazil. The students that these programs 
  reach are primarily of high school age, despite the presence of students over 
  14 years of age in elementary schools. Ninety-six percent of municipal programs 
  concentrate their actions in the distribution of education material to schools, 
  95% conduct lectures, 71% train teachers and 68% conduct prevention workshops,<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a> 
  the same categories seen in 1999.<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The focus on information 
  and seminars, although necessary, is insufficient to promote safer sex and strengthen 
  students' understanding of their own sexuality, which depends on a forum promoting 
  the effective participation of students, as is established by UNGASS target 
  53. In another study, young persons aged 15-24 were those proportionally worse 
  at identifying the causes HIV transmission (62%, compared to 71% of adults 25-39 
  years of age and 67.1% of adults over 40).<sup>25,<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14">14</a></sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to reach young persons not formally enrolled in the
school network, the PN-DST/AIDS initiated pilot projects in 2005
with homeless boys and girls from state capitals and other
metropolitan regions with larges numbers of such children. In
addition, regulations were passed to address the health of
incarcerated youths, which include the components of STD/AIDS
prevention and assistance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Offer of HIV testing and counseling</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The percentage 
  of persons tested increased significantly during recent years, from 20% in 1998 
  to 32.9% in 2005.<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a> Nevertheless, 
  the majority of those tested were women in the age range from 25 to 39 (<a href="#tab4">Table 
  4</a>), a proportion that is explained by the inclusion of HIV testing in prenatal 
  care. These data reveal an important advance in the access of the female population 
  to early HIV/AIDS diagnosis,<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a> 
  but also suggest that men are not being reached by these efforts. Women that 
  are not pregnant probably also do not benefit from these policies. Inequalities 
  were observed in relation to schooling level, geographic regions and race, with 
  black men being the demographic category least tested since the end of the 1990s 
  (22 % in 1998 and 26% in 2005).</font></p>
<p><a name="tab4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29435t4.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are today 
  322 CTAs in Brazil and the process of decentralizing HIV diagnosis from federal 
  to local healthcare networks is ongoing. This is driven partly by the "You Should 
  Know" (<i>Fique Sabendo</i>) campaign launched in 2003 by the federal government,<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a> 
  a program that has increased requests for HIV testing by 30%.<a name="top19"></a><a href="#back19"><sup>19</sup></a> 
  However, because Brazilian policies have developed based on assistance services 
  specialized to AIDS (such as STD/AIDS Reference Centers and CTAs), the incorporation 
  of initiatives related to HIV/AIDS in the basic healthcare network has been 
  relatively slow. HIV testing is considered by technicians difficult to assimilate 
  into the routine of basic healthcare networks and counseling is not well established 
  theoretically, which hampers its expansion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent research with both population and HIV-positive
individuals suggests that counseling is little valued as a
strategic field of prevention.<sup>14,22</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Workplace</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no data 
  on the number of large companies that offer prevention programs, as requested 
  by the UNGASS indicator. In Brazil, initiatives for prevention in the workplace 
  began at the end of the 1980s and the federal government has created mechanisms 
  for the protection of workers affected by the epidemic.<a name="top20"></a><a href="#back20"><sup>20</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite advances 
  in Brazilian legislation,<a name="top21"></a><a href="#back21"><sup>21</sup></a> 
  issues related to employment are the second most frequent cause of rights violations 
  for persons living with HIV/AIDS. The illegal use of HIV testing as a condition 
  of employment is responsible for 7.8% of tests undertaken in the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997, the PN-DST/AIDSinstituted the National Corporate
Council, which comprises 25 large companies and aims to mobilize
the sector toward HIV/AIDS prevention. Since 2005, these Councils
have become decentralized to state level. However, the prevention
strategies adopted by the companies involved do not reach the
most vulnerable workers (unemployed, those with less schooling,
and those linked to the informal or undocumented economy).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent years, STD/AIDS programs have become increasingly
affiliated with labor unions and social services for commerce,
industry and transport to develop initiatives for training and
execution of prevention projects. These services, whose mission
is to educate, train and qualify individuals to re-enter the job
market, target primarily the more vulnerable workers.
Nevertheless, they have limited reach within the country and
until now were primarily carried out in short and discontinuous
programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Harm reduction 
  among Injecting Drug Users</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies<sup>17,24</sup> 
  indicate an HIV prevalence of 0.2% among Injecting Drug Users (IDU) sampled. 
  Considering the relative size of the IDU population, it was possible to estimate 
  that the rate of infection had declined.<a name="top22"></a><a href="#back22"><sup>22</sup></a> 
  This reduction has been attributed to the increased use of crack and to the 
  death of addicts.<sup>1,4,12</sup> Several studies <sup>13,</sup><a name="top23"></a><a href="#back23"><sup>23</sup></a> 
  indicate, however, that there was a significant increase in the percentage of 
  IDUs that abstain from sharing needles, reaching 76% in 1999, demonstrating 
  the efficacy of prevention programs in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The harm reduction 
  strategy adopted by the Ministry of Health has expanded since its enactment 
  in 1994.<sup>13</sup> Initiatives were increased to include not only IDUs, but 
  also users of crack and alcohol. In 2000, this strategy was incorporated into 
  the National Anti-Drug Policy and in 2005, was legislated by the federal government. 
  Its aim is to reach drug users by incorporating needle exchange programs into 
  the services provided by SUS the healthcare network, thus reducing the incidence 
  of HIV and Hepatitis in this population. Five states and nine municipalities 
  from the Southern and Southeastern regions (those most developed in Brazil) 
  have enacted laws specifically targeting damage reduction. This represents a 
  step forward in the strengthening and promotion of prevention policies, but 
  is also evidence of regional inequalities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ongoing decentralization of prevention programs in Brazil
has made the states and municipalities responsible for the
execution and monitoring of these initiatives. One-hundred
thirty-four STD/AIDS prevention projects with drug users were
identified in Brazil.<sup>12</sup> Nevertheless, the PN-DST/AIDS
possesses information only on the 38 such projects that it
funds.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several advances 
  were seen relating to the targets proposed for 2005. Brazil has enacted a large 
  number of prevention programs dedicated to the groups and situations detailed 
  in targets 49, 52 and 53. The reduction of vertical transmission, the increase 
  of testing and the increased use of condom are important results of the plan 
  to reduce individual vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.<sup>6,9,25,</sup><a name="top24"></a><a href="#back24"><sup>24</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this process, 
  the effort to integrate STD/AIDS prevention initiatives into the basic healthcare 
  network is noticeable and is a result of the decentralization policies of the 
  SUS. The PN-DST/AIDS has sponsored descriptive studies and systems to monitor 
  the management of the proposed initiatives and of prevention attitudes, behavior 
  and practices. However, research that evaluates prevention strategies and practices 
  are extremely rare.<sup>10,<a name="top25"></a><a href="#back25">25</a></sup> 
  Likewise, the Latin-American literature concentrates primarily on the in-depth 
  description of only a few, highly localized, projects.<sup>9</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The discussion 
  of local ethics and cultural values, as defined by target 52, depends on the 
  way in which initiatives are undertaken; if groups holding traditional values 
  are being addressed and if minorities are considered; from initial design to 
  the evaluation of results. Men and women may or may not realize their desires 
  and intentions within the limit of their social and cultural context and their 
  moral options, beyond what techno-science can justify and control. The majority 
  of prevention initiatives have some impact (or none) on cultural and symbolic 
  aspects, and not directly on individual conduct; when they can promote important 
  changes, programs can affect other programs, innovate cultural circumstances 
  and change attitudes and practices.<sup>20</sup> Prevention programs, therefore, 
  have a long maturation time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There remain, however, several challenges:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Prevention as 
  a right</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The comparison between the findings herein and the UNGASS
targets confirm that assistance is first instituted and is then
followed by prevention.<sup>9</sup> The social movement in
Brazil, which is fundamental to developing an answer to the AIDS
issue, began fighting for access to high-quality assistance for
carriers and, in the 1990s, for the right to treatment. However,
the right to prevention is still rarely addressed in the agendas
of the social movement and by the entities of social control. In
other words, there is little activism for the "right to
prevention"; the mobilization for <i>access to the prevention
material</i> (condoms and hypodermic needles), for <i>access to
information</i>, <i>education</i>, or <i>high quality
counseling</i>; even where the interface with assistance services
is higher, as is the case with <i>access to quality STD
treatment</i>, of <i>sexual and reproductive health</i> or the
<i>prevention of vertical transmission</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The scarcity of 
  administrative documents from state Health Agencies and of recent research on 
  themes analyzed herein complicates a more in-depth analysis of the targets indicated 
  in the "Prevention" chapter of the Declaration. Thus, creating a monitoring 
  capacity using the network of organizations in civil society at the local level, 
  but able to articulate at the national level, is a substantial challenge. The 
  reference to human rights used in the present context and expounded in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29435t5.gif">Table 
  5</a>, can be useful to this end.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Changes in the field of prevention will also depend on the
momentum of decision-making at the local level. Agreement on
prevention based on the guarantee of rights is more realistic
than attempting to reach a consensus on values, for example.
Defining prevention as a right advances the "banking" analogy,
whereby the participant is a "consumer" of pre-defined proceeds
and values of behavior, leading to a dialogue that includes
subjects and considers their values and sociocultural
contexts.<sup>19</sup> The "banking" concept, for example,
removes from the debate the girl who "wants to marry as a virgin"
and is uncomfortable with the demonstration of condom use in safe
sex workshops, but is infected by her only partner after
marriage. This applies similarly to a young man that, not having
been taught how to protect himself in a homosexual context, will
live his sexual life unprotected and uninformed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The critical analysis of prevention programs can benefit from
the global and local potential of human rights.<sup>23</sup> In
the context of the right to prevention, the participant is not
the object of behavior modification techniques or of persuasion
by marketing. She or he possesses rights and is a citizen who
can, in turn, eventually propose rights (e.g. assisted
fertilization for HIV carriers or distribution of condoms in
school). The language of rights facilitates the continuity of
programs and sustains innovation. The consensus is more robust
when agreement is reached between distinct worldviews without
coercion and where these visions can be shared, understood and
considered in potential solutions.<sup>2</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this way, the lessons learned from long-term endeavors,
which are subject to revision after each election or change of
team, will endure in the face of the openly ethical-political
human rights debate. Interaction and communication, in this
context, permit that values, symbols and feelings (individual or
of a group) find a forum in which to be expressed and debated;
that in the midst of the diverse options and circumstances of
life, recognition exists of the impact of inequality and the
right to differences in actions of protection against HIV.</font></p>
