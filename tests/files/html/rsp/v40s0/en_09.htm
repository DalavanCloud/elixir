<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  The expense of acquiring antiretroviral drugs in Brazil has given rise to debate 
  about the sustainability of the policy of universal access to AIDS medications, 
  despite the evident benefits. The objective of this study was to analyze the 
  evolution of the Ministry of Health's spending on acquiring antiretroviral drugs 
  from 1998 to 2005, the determining factors and the medium-term sustainability 
  of this policy (2006-2008).<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> The study on the evolution of spending on antiretrovirals included 
  analysis of their prices, the year-by-year expenditure, the number of patients 
  utilizing the medication, the mean expenditure per patient and the strategies 
  for reducing the prices maintained during this period. To analyze the sustainability 
  of the policy for access to antiretrovirals, the cost of acquiring the drugs 
  over the period from 2006 to 2008 was estimated, along with the proportion of 
  gross domestic product and federal health expenditure represented by this spending. 
  The data were collected from the Ministry of Health, the Brazilian Institute 
  for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and the Ministry of Planning.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The expenditure on antiretrovirals increased by 66% in 2005, 
  breaking the declining trend observed over the period from 2000 to 2004. The 
  main factors associated with this increase were the weakening of the national 
  generics industry and the unsatisfactory results from the process of negotiating 
  with pharmaceutical companies.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The Brazilian policy for universal access is unsustainable 
  at the present growth rates of the gross domestic product, unless the country 
  compromises its investments in other fields.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Declaration 
  on HIV and AIDS<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> adopted 
  at the Special Session of the United Nations that was held in New York in July 
  2001 established as one of its principles that people living with HIV and AIDS 
  should have access to antiretroviral drugs. In the chapter "Care, Support and 
  Treatment", countries took on the commitment to create national strategies by 
  the year 2003, to deal with and if possible overcome the various obstacles that 
  affect the supply of these drugs. For 2005, countries were called on to make 
  investments aimed at expanding care and access to drugs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The adoption of 
  these targets at a global level is important for reducing the impact of the 
  epidemic, particularly in countries that present structural deficiencies and 
  large-magnitude epidemics. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  three million people die as a result of AIDS every year. Around 80% of them 
  did not have the benefit of the drug therapies available. Although advances 
  have taken place over the last few years, the situation in December 2005 in 
  poor and developing countries was that, out of the 6.5 million individuals who 
  required such treatment, only 1.3 million were receiving it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO and the Joint 
  United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3">3</a></sup> 
  have identified the following barriers to expanding access to medications: countries' 
  inadequate structures for offering health services; limited world capacity for 
  drug production; insufficient financial resources for acquiring such medications; 
  and the consequent damage to public health caused by inequality and social injustice. 
  There have been estimates<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  that, for the period from 2005 to 2008, an additional US$18 billion will be 
  needed for meeting the demands for assistance and prevention relating to HIV/AIDS. 
  For the year 2008 alone, the expenditure on antiretroviral drugs in medium and 
  low-income countries is estimated as US$5.2 billion.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian policy 
  for access to antiretroviral drugs started to be implemented in 1991,<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
  offering the drug zidovudine (AZT). Today, 16 drugs are available within the 
  health system. Decisions on incorporating new antiretrovirals within the Brazilian 
  National Health System (SUS) are made following technical analysis carried out 
  by three advisory committees, which are also responsible for the recommendations 
  for the use and monitoring of these medications.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just as in developed 
  countries and in the few other developing countries that have expanded access 
  to antiretrovirals,<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> the 
  policy for universal access to medications in Brazil has generated unequivocal 
  benefits.<sup>1,7,</sup><a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
  These have occurred both within the collective sphere (through reducing the 
  infectiousness of people living with HIV/AIDS, this contributes towards controlling 
  the epidemic<sup>6</sup>), and at the individual level (through causing substantial 
  increases in the survival and quality of life of people with HIV and AIDS).<sup>1,7,<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6">6</a></sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other benefits that are still partial have been observed in
relation to improvement of the structure and operation of the
Brazilian health system. The AIDS program has functioned as a
paradigm for how the Brazilian health system should operate with
regard to awareness-raising campaigns, partnership with civil
society, supply of materials and careful monitoring.<sup>5</sup>
From an economic point of view, it is undeniable that access to
antiretrovirals has caused a reduction in the expenditure on
hospitalization and therapeutic procedures. An estimate from the
National STD/AIDS Program has indicated savings of more than US$
2 billion over the period from 1997 to 2003.<sup>7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite these results, 
  people living with HIV and AIDS and non-governmental organizations (NGO) have 
  warned that the sustainability of the policy of universal access is at risk, 
  as a result of the progressive increase in expenditure on the acquisition of 
  antiretrovirals. In 2005, the National Health Council recommended to that the 
  Ministry of Health should adopt a system of compulsory licensing of imported 
  medications, in order to reduce the spending resulting from this policy.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reasons for the increase in this spending are: the growth
in the number of people with HIV/AIDS undergoing treatment; the
emergence of viral resistance,<sup>5</sup> which means that
patients have to be treated using more expensive medications, the
so-called second-line drugs; the incorporation of new drugs with
higher prices that those that are already available in the
therapeutic arsenal; the National Industrial Property Law, which
restricts the production of generic versions of original
medications that came onto the market after 1996; and the limited
capacity of national industry to producer new generic medications
in the event of the approval of a compulsory license.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The discussion on the sustainability of the Brazilian policy
involves international questions, especially since the main raw
material-producing countries adopted national legislation on
intellectual property rights in the field of pharmaceuticals, in
consonance with accords established within the context of the
World Trade Organization. The expectation is that the adoption of
these laws &#150; especially by India, in 2005, and almost
simultaneously by China &#150; will limit the worldwide production of
generics and produce an impact on the drug market, thus making it
difficult to obtain reductions in the prices of these products in
poor and developing countries.<sup>2</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this respect, the organization M&eacute;decins Sans
Fronti&egrave;res<sup>2,5</sup> has warned about the "crisis of
second-line drugs". According to this NGO, incorporation of
therapeutic schemes using more expensive medications will have a
financial impact on the access programs. Consequently, developing
countries will have great difficulty in ensuring treatment for
patients using these new products.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To respond to the 
  problem of sustainability, the Brazilian government has adopted a variety of 
  strategies,<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a> among which: 
  production of generic medications; price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies; 
  alteration of the national legislation relating to compulsory licensing; and 
  international action aimed at establishing a consensus that would define access 
  to medications as a question of human rights. The solutions that may be adopted 
  in Brazil will have relevance internationally and will serve as a reference 
  for other developing countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within this context, the objective of the present paper was to
analyze the results from the Brazilian strategies for ensuring
the sustainability of the policy for universal access to
antiretrovirals. For this, the evolution of federal spending on
the acquisition of these drugs was analyzed, along with the
proportion of gross domestic product and federal health
expenditure represented by this spending. In addition to this,
the main challenges to the sustainability of this policy over the
next three years were covered.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To analyze the behavior of the Ministry of Health's spending
on acquiring antiretrovirals over the period from 1998 to 2005,
information was collected on drug prices, year-by-year
expenditure and numbers of patients using antiretrovirals. The
evolution of this spending was then correlated with the
documented information from the National Program for STD/AIDS of
the Ministry of Health regarding the incorporation of new drugs
and the government strategies adopted for reducing the prices of
these drugs, such as negotiations with pharmaceutical companies
and national production of generic drugs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sustainability 
  of the policy for universal access was assessed by considering the percentages 
  of gross domestic product (GDP) and federal health expenditure utilized for 
  purchasing antiretroviral drugs, year by year (1998-2005). The data analyzed 
  were collected from the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE), 
  with regard to GDP figures;<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a> 
  from the Public Health Budget Information System of the Ministry of Health (SIOPS);<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a> 
  and from the Ministry of Planning, with regard to revenue and expenditure within 
  the fiscal budget and relating to social security, for federal health spending.<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The medium-term sustainability of the policy for universal
access was analyzed on the basis of estimates of the commitment
of GDP and federal health expenditure to acquiring
antiretrovirals, over the period from 2006 to 2008. Three
scenarios were evaluated, starting from the hypotheses of GDP
growth rates of 2%, 4% and 6% per year. These rates were also
utilized for estimating federal health expenditure over the same
period, taking into account constitutional determinations
regarding this matter. Following this, the circumstances under
which it would be possible to maintain the policy for universal
access, without compromising other health actions and the fight
against AIDS in Brazil, were verified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To project the 
  expenditure on antiretrovirals to the period between 2006 and 2008, the numbers 
  of patients using antiretrovirals up to 2008 was estimated on the basis of simple 
  linear regression, adjusted to the data from 1998 to 2005 (determination coefficient 
  of 0.99%). This started from the presupposition that the stability in the rates 
  of HIV prevalence and AIDS-related deaths that has been observed since 1998<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a> 
  will be maintained until 2008. The estimated numbers of patients were then multiplied 
  by the mean expenditure on acquiring antiretrovirals per patient/year for 2005.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The potentially avoidable expenditure on acquiring
antiretrovirals was then estimated for the years 2005 to 2008, by
comparing the estimated figures in two situations. In the first,
it was supposed that the expenditure trend would be maintained on
the basis of the lowest mean value per patient in the historical
series studies, i.e. the year 2004; and in the second, the
expenditure was projected according to the parameters observed in
2005, when the expenditure started to increase again. The
difference between the two estimates was considered to be
potentially avoidable expenditure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the economic impact of acquiring antiretrovirals on
the actions of the National Program for STD/AIDS was assessed, by
analyzing the commitment of the budget for this body to
purchasing these drugs, and its commitment to carrying out
programmed actions. Thus, it was possible to assess the capacity
of the National Program to maintain and expand the national
response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, in the light of possible
budget restrictions determined by the high proportion of the
budget accounted for by drug purchases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Evolution of spending on antiretroviral drugs and its
determining factors</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ministry of 
  Health's spending on acquiring antiretroviral drugs (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>) 
  almost tripled in nominal terms over the period from 1998 to 2005, going from 
  R$346 million<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a> per year 
  to R$986 million per year. By observing the mean annual expenditure per patient, 
  three distinct period could be identified. During the first period (1998 and 
  1999), the highest mean spending per patient of the whole series was seen, reaching 
  R$7,781 in 1999. In turn, the total expenditure on acquiring these drugs that 
  year was 64% greater than what was seen in 1998.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29429t1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the second period (2000 to 2004), the beginnings of a
decrease in spending per patient on purchasing AIDS medications
were observed, followed by stabilization. Considering the
increase in the number of new patients (74,500) and the inclusion
of new drugs, the gradual decline in mean expenditure per patient
reached the lowest figure for the whole period analyzed in 2004
(R$4,027). Thus, the growth in total expenditure was only 6.6%
over this period.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third period began in 2005, with increase both in the
Ministry of Health's total spending on acquiring antiretrovirals
(which went from R$594 million in 2004 to R$986 million in 2005),
and in the mean annual expenditure per patient (from R$4,027 to
R$6,124). The growth in total spending on purchasing
antiretrovirals was 66% greater than in 2004, thus reaching a
level equivalent to what was observed during the first period of
the series. The mean expenditure per patient increased by 52.1%,
while the number of new patients undergoing treatment grew by
9.2%, thus denoting a significant increase in medication prices.
The Ministry of Health's 2006 budget for acquiring
antiretrovirals maintains this trend of increasing
expenditure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The high spending during the period from 1998 to 1999 was
associated with the incorporation of new drugs &#150; efavirenz in
1999 and nelfinavir in 1998 &#150; and with a gradual increase in the
numbers of patients undergoing treatment. These two drugs marked
the start of the incorporation of drugs that are protected under
intellectual property rights, into the country's therapeutic
arsenal. In subsequent years, it was the acquisition of
nelfinavir and efavirenz that had the greatest impact on health
budgets destined for acquiring antiretrovirals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the years 
  from 2000 to 2004, one of the factors that gave rise to the reduction in spending 
  on antiretrovirals was Brazilian production of ten different generic drugs of 
  great importance for AIDS treatment, which began in the 1990s. In 2001, 56% 
  of all the antiretroviral drugs consumed were produced nationally, thus providing 
  a reduction of 82% in the prices of these medications over the period from 1996 
  to 2001.<sup>2,</sup><a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The other factor 
  that contributed towards reducing the spending on antiretrovirals over the period 
  from 2000 to 2004 was price negotiations relating to five imported drugs that 
  are protected by patents,<sup>3,4</sup> which took place up to the end of the 
  year 2003 (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29429t2.gif">Table 2</a>). Over this period, as 
  a result of negotiations with pharmaceutical companies, the prices of the drugs 
  efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir and nelfinavir underwent their greatest reductions 
  (73%, 56.2% and 73.8%, respectively). The incorporation of the drugs tenofovir 
  (2003) and atazanavir (2004), at prices lower than those maintained in pharmaceutical 
  companies' countries of origin (43.6% and 76.4% lower, respectively), contributed 
  towards maintaining the trend of reducing the mean expenditure per patient that 
  had been seen up to that time.<sup>4</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand, 
  the negotiations for price reductions that took place between the years 2004 
  and 2005 produced results that were comparatively inferior to those seen during 
  the preceding period. The prices of the drugs nelfinavir and efavirenz remained 
  unchanged, while the price of lopinavir went down by 1%. For the new medications, 
  tenofovir and atazanavir, discounts of 5.2% and 7.7% were obtained, respectively 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29429t2.gif">Table 2</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although with a 
  significantly smaller weighting, the rising trend in the Ministry of Health's 
  spending was also associated with price increases in the drugs produced nationally, 
  especially from 2003 onwards (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29429t2.gif">Table 2</a>). 
  In the year 2005, all the drugs produced nationally had their prices raised 
  in dollar terms, except for saquinavir.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis of the expenditure in relation to GDP and federal
health spending</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impact of spending 
  on antiretrovirals was analyzed in relation to federal investments destined 
  for other areas of the national response to the AIDS epidemic. The budget of 
  the National Program was broken down into the portions utilized for acquiring 
  medications and for other programmed actions (<a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>). 
  It was observed that the investments in developing other actions within the 
  national response did not suffer any negative impact cased by the spending on 
  acquiring medications. On the contrary: there was growth in the share of such 
  expenditure within the budget of the national Program, from around 20% to a 
  little over 30% over the last two years of the series. It was seen that there 
  was no predatory competition for budget resources within the National Program. 
  The need for increased financial resources to meet the expense of acquiring 
  drugs was supplied by resources coming from other actions within the Ministry 
  of Health in the years 2004 and 2005.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29429t3.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  the proportion of GDP represented by the acquisition of antiretrovirals, it 
  was found that such expenditure comprised 0.0509% of GDP in 2005, thus implying 
  a share that was 1.5 times more than in the year 2004 (<a href="#tab4">Table 
  4</a>). The proportion of GDP committed to acquiring antiretrovirals in 2005 
  was similar to what was seen in 1999 and 2000 and 1.3 times greater than in 
  1998. The period of least GDP commitment to purchasing medications (mean of 
  0.035% of GDP) was between the years 2002 and 2004.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29429t4.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proportion of federal health expenditure directed towards
purchasing antiretroviral drugs followed this same trend. It
reached its maximum (3.1%) in 1999, reduced to a minimum in 2004
(1.8%), and returned to a rising trend in the year 2005
(2.7%).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By using the mean 
  cost per patient in 2005 as a reference, it was estimated that, by the end of 
  the subsequent three-year period, there would be a nominal 1.29-fold increase 
  in health expenditure on acquiring medications, i.e. from R$986 million in 2005 
  to R$1,273 million in 2008 (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/html/en_29429t5.htm">Table 5</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering GDP growth of 2% for the period from 2006 to 2008,
it was observed that the proportion of GDP committed to
purchasing antiretrovirals increased. With annual growth of 4%
from 2006 to 2008, there would be stability in the proportion of
GDP applied to acquiring medications over the first two years
and, in the final year of this period, a decreasing trend in this
proportion. It would only be with a growth rate of 6% that a
decline would be seen in the proportion of GDP utilized for
acquiring antiretrovirals. These trends were also observed in
relation to federal health expenditure, starting from the same
hypotheses as used for GDP growth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the financial 
  resources that could be saved in relation to the acquisition of antiretrovirals 
  over the period from 2005 to 2008 were calculated. The difference in total expenditure 
  obtained using the reference points of the mean expenditure per patient in 2004 
  and in 2005 (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/html/en_29429t5.htm">Table 5</a>) was considered 
  to represent avoidable spending. Over the four years analyzed, the savings would 
  be of the order of R$1.5 billion, which would represent a mean annual amount 
  of R$387.5 million. The amount saved would be equivalent to 65% of the spending 
  in 2004 and 39.3% of the spending in 2005.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ministry of Health's increased spending on acquiring AIDS
medications in the year 2005 interrupted a historical series
characterized by a trend towards stabilization of such
expenditure, despite the increase in the numbers of patients
undergoing treatment and the inclusion of new drugs by SUS during
this period. In 2005, the percentages of GDP and federal health
expenditure committed to purchasing antiretrovirals reached a
peak, returning to the levels seen at the end of the 1990s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hypothesis that the increased spending in 2005 was the
result of the incorporation of two new drugs at the end of 2003
should be regarded with reserve, for the following reasons:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As time passes 
        by, the prices of new drugs tend to fall. For example, the incorporation 
        of the drug lopinavir/ritonavir in 2001/2002 did not interrupt the downward 
        trend in spending on acquiring antiretrovirals, since there were reductions 
        in the price of this drug and other imported drugs in subsequent years.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In determining 
        drug prices in different markets, there are factors other than the criterion 
        of originality. In comparing the price of the drug tenofovir in Brazil 
        and the price ascertained internationally by M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res,<sup>2,</sup><a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a> 
        it can be seen that, in 2003, the price of this drug in Brazil was 38% 
        less than what was maintained in the international market. However, two 
        years later, this differential had fallen to only 11.7%, showing that 
        the drop in price in Brazil had not followed the trend seen internationally.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Likewise, correction 
  of the Ministry of Health's spending on antiretrovirals over the years 1998 
  to 2005, in accordance with the general price inflation index, did not alter 
  the observations and conclusions of the present study. The same expenditure 
  trends were maintained over the three periods analyzed: 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 
  2004, and from 2005 onwards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In summary, the present study has shown that the incorporation
of new drugs that are protected by patients and the increase in
the numbers of patients using antiretrovirals are insufficient to
explain the increase in expenditure over the period analyzed. The
changes in spending observed were associated with effective and
efficient adoption of a set of strategies for reducing drug
prices. In this respect, the following can be cited: negotiations
with pharmaceutical companies; the existence of national industry
capable of developing generic drugs; and the government decision
to utilize prerogatives within the Intellectual Property Law when
necessary. The sustainability of the policy for universal access
will therefore depend on the efficiency and effectiveness of
government action in using these strategies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study has also 
  shown evidence of weakening of the national generic drug-producing industry 
  over the last few years. As a result of this, there have been increases in the 
  prices of nationally-produced medications, failures in the supply of generic 
  and similar drugs in the years 2004 and 2005,<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a> 
  and reductions in the scientific and technological capacity of these companies, 
  demonstrated by the lack of incorporation of new generic drugs after the year 
  2001.<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increase in 
  the prices of generic AIDS medications in Brazil has gone against the international 
  trend. Data from the World Health Organization,<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a> 
  corroborated by studies by the organization M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res<sup>2</sup> 
  have shown that, between 2003 and 2005, the prices of first-line medications, 
  composed fundamentally of drugs with generic versions, were reduced by between 
  37 and 53%, depending on the treatment combination adopted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increase in 
  the prices of nationally produced medications has made the prices maintained 
  in Brazil higher than those in the international market today, different to 
  what was observed in the year 2000, according to data from the Ministry of Health 
  and surveys carried out by M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res<sup>2,</sup><a name="top19"></a><a href="#back19"><sup>19</sup></a> 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40s0/en_29429t6.gif">Table 6</a>). In 2000, only one of the six 
  generic or similar drugs for adults utilized in Brazil had a higher price than 
  those in other countries, but in 2005, nine out of the eleven drugs offered 
  for treatments had prices higher than those maintained on the international 
  market. Whereas in 2000 the mean price of medications produced in Brazil corresponded 
  to 91.8% of the price for generic drugs commercialized internationally, in 2005 
  the Brazilian prices were on average three times higher than the lowest prices 
  observed worldwide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, it is emphasized that the results from price
negotiations depend on the real capacity for national production
of patented drugs, insofar as this allows the differential in
prices between patented medications and those produced in this
country to be made clear.<sup>3</sup> It has to be stressed that
national production is not totally limited by the intellectual
property law. The development and registration of generic drugs,
according to Brazilian legislation and the World Trade
Organization, can take place while a patent is in force, but
their commercial limitation is limited.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alternatively, the strengthening of the national industry
could take place through the development of drugs that are not
protected by patents, as has been the case with enteric
didanosine (DDI), or by means of combinations of generic drugs.
Approximately 80% of all medications commercialized around the
world are not subject to patents and could be produced
nationally.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Non-utilization 
  of the prerogatives provided for in the accords on intellectual property, such 
  as compulsory licensing, may also have contributed towards increasing the expenditure 
  on antiretrovirals. The government altered the legislation on this matter in 
  2003,<a name="top20"></a><a href="#back20"><sup>20</sup></a> to allow the importation 
  of generic medications, and in 2004 decreed that lopinavir/ritonavir was a medication 
  of "public utility",<a name="top21"></a><a href="#back21"><sup>21</sup></a> 
  which is the first legal stage towards compulsory licensing. The lack of greater 
  political determination within the government, in this respect, weakened the 
  Ministry of Health's negotiating power, and also cast doubt on the capacity 
  to produce new drugs nationally.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The trend towards setting aside increased proportions of GDP
and federal health expenditure for acquiring antiretrovirals
demonstrates that the sustainability of the policy for access to
antiretroviral drugs will only be ensured if the country grows at
an annual rate of 6% over the next three years, a scenario that
has been shown to be unlikely. Alternatively, it could be ensured
if portions of the budget destined for other health actions and
AIDS control actions were redirected, and/or if there were the
political will to promote the strengthening of the national
generics industry, with the aim of achieving reductions in drug
prices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional studies should be conducted to refine the topics
and hypotheses presented in this paper, such as in relation to
prospection for potentially avoidable expenditure that considers
the effect of new drugs that will be incorporated into the
therapeutic arsenal, or even with regard to the repercussion that
increasing numbers of people undergoing treatment will have on
the international generics market and the cost of generics in
Brazil.</font></p>
