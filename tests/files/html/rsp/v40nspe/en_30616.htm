<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The deficiencies in Brazilian science and technology policies
with regard to the challenges of the twenty-first century are
discussed, while acknowledging that these policies have in some
respects been very successful. The importance of health research
within the framework of general endeavors in science, technology
and innovation in this country is also demonstrated. The
distribution of research around the world is then summarized, and
a specific position is claimed for Brazil, along with some other
countries, within the global panorama. Some elements needed for
maturation of the sectoral system for health innovation are
discussed. Finally, the need for the presence of the Ministry of
Health within the panorama of health research, for this
maturation process to take place adequately, is discussed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>HEALTH RESEARCH 
  IN BRAZIL: CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Science and technology policies at world level relating to the
period from just after the Second World War to the present day
were classified by Ruivo<sup>12</sup> into three "phases" or
"paradigms". On this basis, Brazil has entered the twenty-first
century notably out of step with leading countries around the
world. According to this author, these three phases are: 1)
"science as the motor of progress", which guided science and
technology policies from the end of the Second World War until
the mid-1960s; 2) "science as a problem-solver", which lasted
until the mid-1980s; and 3) "science as a source of strategic
opportunities", which has been developing up to the present
day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until the end of 
  the twentieth century, Brazil presented a science and technology policy sustained 
  by principles, strategies, regulatory norms and institutions that contained 
  strong elements of the first phase and only some elements of the second phase. 
  <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30616t1.gif">Table 1</a> presents a summary of the characteristics 
  of these three phases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What were the principal 
  characteristics of science and technology policies holding sway until the end 
  of the 1990s? The most important and enduring of these is certainly the idea 
  of "science as the motor of progress" or, said in another way, the hegemony 
  of the explanations of technical progress as a linear process based on the offer 
  of knowledge. The strength of this notion is, for example, confirmed by the 
  virtuous path taken by a federal support agency that was created to overcome 
  it. The <i>Fincanciadora de Estudos e Projetos</i> (Finep - Studies and Projects 
  Funding Agency) was dreamed up in the second half of the 1960s as a technological 
  support arm for Brazilian industry. Continuing along Ruivo's analytical scheme, 
  it was envisaged as a tool through which Brazil could advance to the second 
  of the phases indicated in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30616t1.gif">Table 1</a>. Despite 
  the introduction of various elements of this new phase in Brazil &#150; non-refundable 
  large-scale finance, the "integrated programs" in which elements of priority 
  definitions were outlined (the <i>Programa Integrado de Doen&ccedil;as End&ecirc;micas</i> 
  &#91;Integrated Endemic Diseases Program&#93;, for example<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>), 
  and the programs for directly financing companies &#150; the actions by Finep 
  in the 1970s, by then governing the <i>Fundo Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico 
  e Tencnol&oacute;gico</i> (FNDCT - National Fund for Scientific and Technological 
  Development), ended up directing most of their energies towards financing the 
  construction of the Brazilian postgraduate system. This task, which was relevant 
  and extremely successful, was achieved on a conceptual basis governed predominantly 
  by the offer of academic knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The construction of the postgraduate system shows another
important characteristic of science and technology policies in
Brazil that also helps in understanding the Brazilian version of
the model based on science as the "motor of progress". It
entailed growth with a horizontal pattern, without well-defined
priorities, similar to the strategy of import substitution seen
in Brazilian industrialization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Policies like this, 
  over the last half century, have constructed a system that, according to a census 
  by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq - 
  <i>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e Tecnol&oacute;gico</i>),<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  consists of almost 20,000 research groups and more than 75,000 active researchers 
  who are conducting research in practically all the fields that are researched 
  in the world. These policies have led Brazil from the 27<sup>th</sup> position 
  in the production of scientific articles in 1981 (0.4% of world production) 
  to 18<sup>th</sup> position in 2001 (1.4% of word production).<sup>7</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nonetheless, there are two important challenges to be faced,
among others. Firstly, at least to sustain the positive outcome
from the last three decades in the next three ones. And secondly,
to increase the rate of incorporation of scientific and
technological knowledge into new processes and products that are
capable of meeting the needs and desires of Brazilians.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For this, it is necessary to recover the lost time in updating
the national science and technology policies. The zero point for
these policies around the world is the year 1945 and, in 1951,
Brazil adapted to the trends in leading countries by creating the
then CNPq. In the middle of the 1960s, the resurgence of the
Japanese economy led the United States, and subsequently other
developed Western countries, to revise the model based on the
demand side of knowledge. At the beginning of the 1970s, Brazil
attempted to adjust to the market-pull model for industrial
competitiveness, through the combination of Finep and FNDCT.
Financial globalization, the basic reference for the transition
to the third phase in postwar science and technology policies, is
a phenomenon of the 1980s. The Brazilian efforts towards updating
its science and technology policies only started at the end of
the 1990s, almost 20 years later. In this sense too, the 1990s
was a lost decade. To face up to these challenges, reforms in
national science and technology policies are needed, in order to
overcome the characteristics indicated early, even though they
had been capable of constructing a significant research system
within the perspective of a developing country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last few years, positive changes have arisen through
the creation of Sectoral Funds; the drafting of the Industrial,
Technological and Foreign Trade Policy, the Innovation Law and
the decree that regulates it; the creation of the Support Program
for the Pharmaceutical Industry (Pr&oacute;-Farma) by the
<i>Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&ocirc;mico e Social</i>
(BNDES - National Bank for Economic and Social Development); and
the implementation of Law No. 11,196 (a tax concessions law) and
the bill of law that regulated the FNDCT. Three characteristics
are highlighted by this set of changes: 1) increase in the
capacity for induction, in the sense of reconciling scientific
merit and priorities defined by players within and outside of the
scientific community; 2) emphasis on the technological component
and the search for innovation, thus shifting the traditional
balance observed in research conducted in this country, which has
been predominantly scientific; 3) reinforcement of the business
component, thus directly stimulating companies or considering
their association with research groups and institutions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One probable result from these changes that is important for
the health sector is the reinforcement of the vertical sectoral
components for research support. The reinforcement of the
mechanisms for inducing and establishing priorities, as proposed
in the regulations for the sectoral funds and the industrial
policy (which also has sectoral priorities), work towards
attenuating the tradition in the science and technology policies
in Brazil that is based on the offer of knowledge.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE PLACE OF 
  HEALTH RESEARCH IN THE WORLD AND IN BRAZIL</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A survey carried 
  out by the Global Forum for Health Research<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  showed that, in 2001, almost 106 billion dollars were spent on research and 
  development around the world. Public sources were responsible for 44% and private 
  sources for 56% of that sum. The same survey also indicated an expenditure growth 
  rate of almost 25% between 1998 and 2001. Around 96% of the total resources 
  came from sources in developed countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an analysis of the worldwide distribution of health
research through a different prism, Paraje et al<sup>11</sup>
(2005) showed that 90.4% of the world's scientific-technological
bibliographic output was concentrated in 42 high-income countries
and, of these, the five most productive countries (United States,
United Kingdom, Japan, Germany and France) accounted for 72.5% of
the total production. The remaining 9.6% were distributed thus:
1.7% among 63 low-income countries, 5.4% among 54 lower
middle-income countries and 2.5% among 31 upper middle-income
countries. It is worth highlighting the small presence of upper
middle-income countries in relation to those of lower
middle-income. The leading five countries in this latter subgroup
(China, Russian Federation, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa)
account for 4.4% of the 5.4%. If the share corresponding to the
production from India (a low-income country) is added to this
4.4%, it can be seen that almost 6% of world output in health
research is located in just a few countries, among which Brazil.
This group was recently given the name Innovative Developing
Countries (IDC).<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This title was derived from a conceptual framework proposed by
Mashelkar,<sup>8</sup> in which the economic strength of a
country is compared with its autochthonous research capacity.
Within this perspective, a set of countries with a well-developed
research capacity can be identified, even though these countries
are not (yet) world economic leaders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The health sector in Brazil today mobilizes between 7.5% and
8% of GDP, and around 40% of this effort comes from the public
sector, within the three spheres of government. In addition to
the immense network of service provision, the health sector
incorporates an important industrial sector that is responsible
for manufacturing medications, diagnostic devices, equipment,
vaccines and blood derivatives. This segment is intensive in
technology and innovation, although such activities are
predominantly developed abroad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent survey 
  on the funding of health research in this country that was commissioned by the 
  Ministry of Health<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> revealed 
  that, between 2000 and 2002, the mean annual expenditure on health research 
  and development had reached US$573 million. The survey included all the universities 
  and institutes with health research activities, the Ministries of Health, Science 
  and Technology (with their support agencies) and Education, along with the principal 
  research support agencies belonging to Brazilian states. The data relating to 
  the private sector were extracted from the Technological Innovation Survey by 
  the <i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica</i> (IBGE - Brazilian 
  Institute for Geography and Statistics).<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a> 
  The private sector was represented by the pharmaceutical industry (245 companies) 
  and health equipment industry (368 companies). Some aggregated data extracted 
  from this survey are shown in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30616t2.gif">Table 2</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30616t2.gif">Table 
  2</a> show a situation that was very typical of an IDC, with three characteristics 
  that reveal an immature national innovation system:</font></p>

<ol>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <li> a significant volume of financial resources destined for health research 
    and development, corresponding to 1.5% of national health spending and 3.3% 
    of public national health spending;</li>
  <li>a relatively small participation by the private industrial sector in the 
    health research and development spending;</li>
  <li> significant autochthonous capacity for research and development funding, 
    expressed through the fact that only 3.5% of the financial resources injected 
    into the system were from sources outside Brazil.</li>
  </font>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It can also be 
  seen that there was a small financial presence from the national health authority 
  in the research and development activities (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30616t2.gif">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most wide-ranging 
  data on the installed capacity for health research in Brazil are available from 
  the Research Groups Directory, a database belonging to the Lattes platform of 
  CNPq. The key to identifying health research activities was the link that lines 
  of research had with the "human health" sector of activity, as informed by the 
  leader of the research group. This methodology has been utilized since 2001.<sup>6</sup> 
  According to this criterion, health research was performed by all research groups 
  with at least one line associated with this sector, independent of the predominant 
  field of knowledge in their activities. Likewise, all researchers linked with 
  these research lines related to the human health sector were considered to be 
  the critical mass involved in health research in Brazil at that time. <a href="#tab3">Table 
  3</a> presents the dimensions of the health research activities in Brazil in 
  relation to the total volume of research carried out in this country.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30616t3.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2004, health research activities represented around
one-third of all research activity in Brazil, without taking
companies into account.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Research groups relating to all the main field of knowledge
had research lines connected with the "human health" sector of
activity. Around 50% of the groups were within health sciences
and just under 25% within biological sciences. The remaining
quarter was within other large fields of knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medicine was the predominant field of knowledge in almost 20%
of the groups that conducted health research, but the dispersion
among other fields was very large. Health research was being
conducted in groups for which the predominant activities were
categorized in 72 out of the 75 fields in the CNPq tree. However,
the 15 fields that were most present accounted for 71% of the
groups.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The geographical distribution of the general and health
research activities presented the same pattern of regional
concentrations: 63% of the groups were in the southeastern
region, 17% in the southern region, 13% in the northeastern
region, 5% in the center-west region and 2% in the northern
region.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Health research 
  can be subdivided into four segments: clinical, biomedical, technological and 
  public health. Even though there is still no precise methodology for distributing 
  the groups between these four segments, a first attempt to differentiate between 
  the 18,351 lines linked to the human health sector of activity has established 
  the following divisions.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
  Clinical research incorporates all the research lines in which the primary link 
  is psychology and some lines linked to nutrition and pharmacy, and in addition 
  to this, it incorporates all the lines in which the primary link is health sciences, 
  except for those linked with public health. Biomedical research incorporates 
  all the lines primarily linked to the large field of biological sciences, and 
  some lines linked to pharmacy and nutrition. Public health research incorporates 
  all the lines linked to collective health, and those linked to applied social 
  sciences and human sciences, except for psychology. Technological health research 
  incorporates all the lines primarily linked to engineering and exact sciences, 
  and in addition to this, it incorporates many research lines linked to agricultural 
  science and some lines linked to nutrition and pharmacy. The results, in <a href="#tab4">Table 
  4</a>, show the predominance of clinical research, accounting for almost half 
  of Brazilian efforts in health research.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE CHALLENGE 
  OF MATURING THE NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEM FOR HEALTH</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concept of National Innovation Systems belongs to the
field of the technology economy and was developed in Europe and
the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. It sought to comprehend
the connection processes between the large numbers of players
involved in how new products and processes appear on the market,
and particularly those involving advanced scientific and
technological knowledge. According Albuquerque<sup>1</sup>
(1996), a National Innovation System is "an institutional
construction that is the product of planned and conscious action
or the sum of unplanned and disconnected decisions that moves
technological progress forward in complex capitalist economies.
By constructing this innovation system, the information flows
needed for the technological innovation process are enabled".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The development of the concept was based initially on an
examination of the world's leading economies and was then
extended to the countries that have industrialized more recently,
among which the IDCs. The concept has also more recently been
extended to economic sectors (sectoral innovation systems). On
characteristic of these sectoral systems is the presence of great
heterogeneity in the innovation process between different sectors
and their subsectors.<sup>5</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main focus of such studies in generally placed on the
relationships between public and private players with regard to
economic development. The link between national innovation
systems and increases in social welfare and inclusion is a
terrain yet to be explored. In Brazil, prominence needs to be
given to the research by Albuquerque et al,<sup>2</sup> who
discussed the possibilities in the health field of "combined
construction of an innovation system and a social welfare system"
and the studies by Gadelha<sup>3</sup> and Gadelha et
al,<sup>4</sup> who coined and developed the concept of the
"productive health complex".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The principal challenge 
  for the health research and development system in Brazil relates to the maturation 
  of the health innovation system. Among other matters, this signifies:</font></p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The importance 
  of the knowledge developed in research institutions for advancing the health 
  production complex is well known, particularly its components of biotechnological 
  nature, such as medications, vaccines and diagnostic devices. The recent regulating 
  of the Innovation Law has opened the way towards establishing such bridges. 
  On the other hand, it is also known that the place for innovation, par excellence, 
  is companies. However, even with the recent political and legal advances, the 
  direct support channels to companies for research and development projects are 
  still very obstructed. Nonetheless, as already mentioned, there is a need to 
  join together the Sectoral Innovation System for health as an economic category 
  (generators of employment and income through production) to the health sector 
  as a social inclusion category (generator of employment and income through increases 
  in welfare).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For this, it will be essential to develop what perhaps is the
principal support tool for health innovation in companies and
which could also bring the Ministry of Health to the center of
research and development actions: the utilization of the
purchasing capacity of this ministry as an instrument of
technological policy. Among the various possibilities of such
utilization, the furnishing of guarantees to BNDES and Finep
linked to purchases for the National Health System (SUS)
(medications, vaccines, equipment and others) that are made by
health secretariats in the Ministry of Health can be
highlighted.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE ROLE OF 
  THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH IN RESEARCH</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between 2004 and the end of 2006, the <i>Departamento de
Ci&ecirc;ncia e Tecnologia da Secretaria de Ci&ecirc;ncia,
Tecnologia e Insumos Estrat&eacute;gicos</i> (MS/SCTIE/Decit;
part of the Ministry of Health &#91;Department of Science and
Technology of the Secretariat of Science, Technology and
Strategic Supplies&#93;) will have disbursed around US$100 million
for supporting health research in Brazil. These resources are
added to funds coming from other ministries and agencies in the
Brazilian states and are put to work with technical support from
CNPq, Finep and almost all the research support foundations
(FAPs) in the country. These agencies also allocate resources
from their budgets and the Sectoral Funds to the projects
supported by Decit (a further US$25 million).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These actions are carried out through efforts to construct
from the concepts: to translate these concepts into an explicit
political formulation and gain agreement for this policy, and
also for a research priority agenda, with government agencies,
researchers, health administrators and SUS users.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are two basic reasons why the Ministry of Health should
occupy a central place in the health research policy. The first
of these is to bring together the health research agendas and
public health policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In many developing countries with some tradition in research,
in particular in the Americas, the science, technology and
innovation policy is governed by bodies similar to CNPq and by
other agencies, which may or may not be subordinate to a ministry
with horizontal (transversal) action, like the Ministry of
Science and Technology. Within the field of science and
technology, horizontal actions relate to all fields of knowledge,
without "specializations". Their counterpart is sectoral
(vertical) actions, which deal with specific sectors of activity.
In Brazil, the principal example of sectoral activity is the
agricultural and livestock sector. In this, the Ministry of
Agriculture (which is a sectoral ministry, unlike the Ministry of
Science and Technology) is the principal player in research
activities, through the actions of the <i>Empresa Brasileira de
Pesquisa Agropecu&aacute;ria</i> (Embrapa - Brazilian Company for
Agricultural and Livestock Research). However, the agriculture
and livestock sector is an exception. There are other reasons
involved, but it is indisputable that the success of Brazilian
scientific-technological research and innovation in the
agriculture and livestock sector is greatly due to the decision,
taken in 1973, of verticalizing its research policy. This success
has been both scientific-academic (measured by an international
presence among authors of articles that is above the national
average for all areas), and technological and innovatory
(measured by success in agribusiness and family agriculture).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In essence, the verticalization of a sectoral policy for
science, technology and innovation brings its priorities closer
to those of the sectoral policy as a whole. For this movement to
be a success, there are other important variables involved, such
as the degree of priority of the sectoral policy within the
government's overall priorities and, even more relevantly, the
economic importance of the sector within the overall economy.
These two conditions were present in the case of the agricultural
and livestock sector and are also present in the health
sector.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second reason 
  why the Ministry of Health must have a role of greater importance within health 
  research is the need to carry more financial resources over to research and 
  to find new sources of funds. Referring back to the recent survey on financial 
  flows within health research and development in Brazil (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30616t2.gif">Table 
  2</a>), it can be seen that, although the sums coming from the private sector 
  are considerable, a closer look at them reveals another picture, as the data 
  in <a href="#tab5">Table 5</a> show.</font></p>
<p><a name="tab5"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30616t5.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It can be noted that around 85% of the expenditure is destined
for the training, sustention and stimulus of the human resources
involved in research and development. The public resources
destined for activities solely related to stimulating research
projects are modest in comparison with the installed capacity for
health research in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is within this context that the backing of around US$100
million for the three-year period 2004-2006 provided by
MS/SCTIE/Decit must be assessed. It represents an increase of
around 60% in total expenditure, except for bursaries and
salaries, in relation to the expenditure on health research in
the three-year period 2000-2002.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the historical subterfuges for justifying the small
extramural presence of the Ministry of Health within the research
and development scene in Brazil since its creation in 1953 was to
consider that only the research capable of bringing immediate
responses to the demands of public health would be of interest to
the Ministry of Health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The increasing pace of the advance of knowledge and the
resultant increase in competition for its utilization within the
sphere of the health production complex have changed the face of
health research and development, thereby decreasing the time
taken to transform new knowledge into new products or process and
increasing the space for so-called "strategic" research. This
change is characterized by exploration of the frontiers of
knowledge while, from the outset of the project, taking into
consideration the practical utilization of possible new
knowledge. In other words, this type of research operates within
the environment of "disinterested" research: it makes use of its
rigorous conceptual basis and methodological and technical tools
while, however, always having an arrival point in mind that is
connected with the resolution of a concrete problem within human
health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growth in the space for strategic research has, throughout
the world, attracted legions of health investigators,
particularly bioscientists, thus modifying their research
interests, attracting them to new lines of activity and altering
their careers. Strategic research has suggested a probable new
type of research called "translational" and has coined an
explanatory expression for the shift in interests: "from the
bench to the bedside".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activities of the Ministry of Health in the field of
research and development should extend to all the areas capable
of increasing the coverage and efficacy of health actions. To
adequately place the large installed capacity for health research
in Brazil at the service of improving the population's health
conditions, the Ministry of Health needs to expand its vision,
through making itself available to support the different links in
the chain of knowledge within health research, with special
attention to strategic research. An approach of this nature
presupposes abundant resources, which is not the case.
Consequently, it becomes necessary to establish priorities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed budget 
  for the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) for 2005 was US$28.6 
  billion (around 80% for extramural research and 10% for its own institutes). 
  It would be reasonable to think that, with this quantity of resources, the idea 
  of establishing priorities for research support could be abandoned. However, 
  the NIH, which is answerable to the equivalent of the Ministry of Health in 
  the United States, does establish its priorities. They are very extensive, of 
  course, but indispensable for justifying requests to Congress for funds. Equally, 
  all bodies for stimulating health research around the developed world establish 
  their priorities, at a much more modest budget level but nonetheless still impressive 
  in relation to Brazilian standards.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the problem of scarcity of financial resources,
definition of priorities is essential for establishing the first
justification for the Ministry of Health to occupy itself with
health research administration. Determining priorities is
essential for the research agenda to be brought closer to public
health policies. In 2003 and 2004, Decit/SCTIE worked towards
constructing a national agenda, starting from a debate with
health researchers, administrators and users. The proposal was
discussed and approved at the Second National Conference on
Science, Technology and Innovation in Health, which was held in
Bras&iacute;lia in 2004.<sup>9</sup> This agenda, which is
continually undergoing updates, has been guiding the research
stimulation actions of the Ministry of Health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Historically, the participation by the Ministry of Health in
Brazilian efforts within health research was centered on internal
stimulation actions, through its own research institutes, and in
particular the <i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Oswaldo Cruz</i>. In
2003, the conceptual basis and policies of the new proposal were
launched and, since 2004, the Ministry of Health's actions have
been expanded towards more vigorous extramural stimulation
activities, seeking to reach all of the institutions and research
groups active with health-related activities in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The greatest fragility 
  of the proposal is its low level of institutionality. Everything that was done 
  between 2003 and the present day has been sustain solely by the sensitivity 
  and political will of the team directing the ministry. For this policy to be 
  incorporated into the government &#150; and by extension, to be transformed 
  into State policy, with the incorporation of the scientific and technological 
  research within the sphere of the tasks of SUS &#150; it will be necessary to 
  put the proposals onto a more institutional footing. And one of the most important 
  measures for achieving this in our setting is to create a research stimulation 
  body connected to the Ministry of Health, along the lines of the bodies that 
  exist in the leading countries for health research in the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the 30 countries with offices and representation in the
Pan-American Health Organization, it is only in the United States
and Canada that the government bodies responsible for public
health policies govern health research. These are also the only
countries in which this governing action is carried out by means
of the activities of a specific body for health research
stimulation. These two countries, which are world leaders in this
field of research, did not attain this leadership solely by
having their sectoral research policies linked to the respective
sectoral ministries. Nonetheless, it is not improper to think
that the choice of this path may have contributed towards
sustaining this position.</font></p>
