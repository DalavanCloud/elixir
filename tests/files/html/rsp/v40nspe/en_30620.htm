<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of the present study was to comment on the possible
existence of editorial prejudice among the editors of scientific
journals from Northern countries against Southern authors. We
highlight that a study using bibliometric methods documented an
important imbalance in terms of the international scientific
production of health researchers from high-income countries (the
"North") and those from low and middle-income countries (the
"South"). In a survey of Brazilian researchers, three in every
four blamed this imbalance, at least in part, on prejudice among
international editors. This is supported by the fact that a very
small percentage of editorial board members of international
journals come from the South. Although prejudice can explain part
of the imbalance, there are also specific measures that may
increase the likelihood of a paper from the South being accepted
in international journals. These include the need to invest in
the quality of the written text, and to show empathy with editors
and readers, emphasizing the contribution of the manuscript to
the international literature. Finally, we discuss whether
research carried out in the South should be published in national
or international journals, and suggest that there are at least
six dimensions to this choice. These include language and target
audience; type of contribution to knowledge; generalizability;
citation index; speed of publication; and open access. The rapid
growth in the number of Brazilian contributions to the
international health literature shows that editorial prejudice,
although often present, can be effectively offset by research
with solid methodology and good-quality presentation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE PROBLEM</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A comprehensive international review of the distribution of
scientific publications in the health field was recently
published, analyzing entries in the major bibliometric databases
between 1992 and 2001. This review showed that 90.4% of published
articles were from high-income countries, 7.9% from middle-income
countries (including Brazil, with 0.7%), and 2.7% from low-income
countries.<sup>6</sup> These conclusions have been confirmed by
similar studies.<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such marked imbalance 
  may be explained by a number of factors. First, scientific production in low 
  and middle-income countries (or "the South") is inarguably inferior to that 
  of high-income countries ("the North"). This is due to a variety of factors, 
  including less funding for research, fewer researchers and laboratories, and 
  the migration of scientists to rich countries, among others. Second, pressure 
  to publish in certain Southern countries is &#150; or at least used to be &#150; 
  much less intense than in Northern countries. A third explanation may be the 
  greater use, especially in the field of public health, of qualitative and observational 
  designs &#150; such as ecological and cross-sectional studies<sup>1</sup> &#150; 
  which are less valued in the international literature than experimental studies.<sup>14</sup> 
  A fourth factor is that the share of the scientific production of the South 
  published in national journals is not adequately assimilated by international 
  databases. Finally, there is the possibility of editorial prejudice, which is 
  the subject of the present article.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There seems to 
  be a generalized perception among Brazilian scientists that editors of journals 
  published in Northern countries &#150; especially English-speaking countries, 
  which concentrate the majority of high-impact journals &#150; may be prejudiced 
  against articles from the South. Reports such as the one transcribed below are 
  frequent:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>A renowned 
    journal published an article based on a North-American cohort, showing that 
    breastfeeding protected against overweight in children and adolescents aged 
    9-14 years.</i><sup>3</sup> <i>This survey did not use a population-based 
    sample, and information on breastfeeding were obtained retrospectively from 
    mothers when children were in the age range studied. Information on weight 
    and height were also reported by mothers, and a single outcome (body mass 
    index) was evaluated. Response rate in this study was below 50%. The journal 
    also published an editorial highlighting the importance of breastfeeding for 
    the prevention of obesity. After a few weeks, we submitted to the same journal 
    an article based on a Brazilian population-based birth cohort, in which over 
    2000 18-year olds were weighed, measured, and had their body composition evaluated 
    by our team using standardized procedures. Information on the duration of 
    breastfeeding had been collected on occasion of three visits taken place during 
    the first four years of life, and 80% of original cohort members were traced 
    at age 18 years. Our study showed no association between breastfeeding and 
    eight different indicators of overweight, obesity, body composition, and height. 
    The article was refused immediately. We appealed to the editor, without success. 
    The article was eventually published in another international journal, whose 
    editors were more receptive.</i><sup>13</sup></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In academic life, 
  few things are more frustrating than receiving a letter stating that "we believe 
  your article to be more adequate for publication at the local or regional level." 
  Or instead: "we receive a much greater number of articles than we can publish, 
  and the priority rating of your article was not sufficiently high to warrant 
  its inclusion..." The author often feels like Snoopy in <a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a>.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an attempt to 
  quantify this collective experience, we carried out a survey including the 351 
  first authors of articles published in 2005 in Brazilian journals <i>Revista 
  de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>, <i>Cadernos de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>, 
  and <i>Revista Brasileira de Epidemiologia</i>. We asked authors whether, in 
  their opinion, "<i>are the editors of journals produced in rich countries prejudiced 
  against articles submitted by researchers from less developed countries such 
  as Brazil?</i>" Of the authors contacted, 30% did not respond after two attempts. 
  The distribution of valid answers is presented in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. 
  Three-quarters of respondents agreed completely (25%) or partially (50%) with 
  the statement. Only 8% said to disagree completely with the statement.</font></p>
<p><a name="fig2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30620f2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the survey, several colleagues expressed their opinions
on the issue. Most commentaries included statements such as "<i>I
agree that there is some degree of prejudice, but our articles
also show problems and peculiarities that render them
insufficiently attractive.</i>" Problems most frequently
mentioned include deficiencies in English writing and the overall
poor quality of some articles. Peculiarities included the study
of health problems of local importance, with little international
relevance; the fact that many results are very specific to the
Brazilian settings (such as, for instance, in evaluations of
services and programs); and the interest of Southern countries in
issues related to inequities in healthcare, a subject of little
interest to many Northern journals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The perception of this problem is not a recent phenomenon. In
1995, Breilh,<sup>2</sup> from Ecuador, indicated that the
scientific production of Latin America was virtually "invisible"
in North America and Europe: "<i>there is an Olympian ignorance
regarding books, studies, and instrumental innovations generated
in the heart of Latin America</i>."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 2002 International Congress of Epidemiology, in
Montreal, there was a round table conference on this subject,
which included the editors of some international journals. At
this meeting, the first author of the present article presented a
review of articles published in the International Journal of
Epidemiology (IJE) and American Journal of Epidemiology (AJE) in
2000 and 2001. In the former, 11% of first authors of published
articles were from Southern countries, versus 6% in the latter.
These results were compared to the percentage of members of the
editorial boards of these journals that, at that time, worked in
Southern countries: none of the 65 associate editors of AJE, and
two out of 16 in IJE. None of the 30 board members of
Epidemiology were from the South. The scenario was slightly
better for the American Journal of Public Health, where two out
of nine associate editors were from low or middle-income
countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This important discussion gained in intensity in 2003, when
Saxena et al<sup>9</sup> published a letter in Lancet showing
that, of the 530 members of the editorial boards of the 10 most
important psychiatric journals, only four were from the South.
This letter was followed by an inflamed commentary by the
journal's editor, highlighting the fact that only eight of the
111 board members of the five most important medical journals
were from the South.<sup>4</sup> This editor used the expression
"institutional racism," and his commentary was followed by
letters and articles demonstrating such imbalance in the fields
of tropical health,<sup>5</sup> pediatrics,<sup>11</sup> and
psychiatry.<sup>12</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, it seems 
  beyond doubt that there is a certain degree of prejudice against Southern articles, 
  but it does not seem fair to blame this prejudice entirely on editors. In the 
  following sections, we shall discuss certain recent trends in international 
  publishing that may contribute to reduce this problem.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>WHAT'S NEW?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aforementioned review of health-related scientific
production from 1992 to 2001<sup>6</sup> also reported a few
positive findings. The major time trend detected in the period
was a marked increase in the proportion of publications coming
from Brazil, China, and the Republic of Korea. Despite this
increase, Brazil accounted for only 0.73% of publications in the
studied period, still placing behind small countries such as
Finland and Denmark.<sup>6</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much of the Brazilian progress must be credited to the notable
expansion in the country's postgraduate and research sector taken
place in the last few decades. The fact that many Brazilian
authors are breaking the barriers of international publication
proves that these obstacles are not insurmountable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand, there is also evidence of changes in
attitude in some international journals. We list a few of them
below, again in a somewhat anecdotic fashion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Medical Journal, when requesting an editorial from
a North-American colleague, pointed out that "<i>we are anxious
that our editorials should have as much international appeal as
possible because of our international readership. A global view
of the subject is therefore essential for our readers&#133; this
editorial should have a coauthor who is from a developing
country</i>."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The editor of the American Journal of Public Health, when
inviting the first author of the present article to be an
Associate Editor, highlighted that "<i>I am looking for an
international associate editor to ensure that critical public
health research from outside of the United States is brought to
the attention of our readers."</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, Lancet began to indicate a body of 100 editorial
consultants, of which 25 are to be from Europe, 25 from North
America, and the other 50 from the rest of the world. Two
Brazilians have already been indicated. This journal has been
giving priority to issues related to diseases affecting poor
countries, and practically all numbers include at least one
article on this subject, a fact which has been confirmed by an
independent bibliometric evaluation.<sup>10</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The measures above, 
  although still timid, may contribute to reduce publication bias against the 
  South. In the next section, we shall discuss what can be done by Brazilian authors 
  and institutions.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>WHAT WE CAN 
  DO ABOUT IT</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This section is elaborated based on the first author's
experience as an editorial consultant and reviewer of
international journals, when evaluating a manuscript from the
South.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first problem is the quality of writing. Many manuscripts
submitted by Brazilian authors are very poorly written. Poor
writing leads the editor or reviewer <i>a priori</i> to tend
towards rejection. Writing well in scientific English is very
difficult, even for researchers with postgraduate training
outside Brazil. Revision by a qualified translator may help, but
if the latter is not experienced in writing scientific articles,
his or her help may make the text even worse. Research groups
that wish to increase their international projection should
seriously consider hiring specialized scientific writers, if
possible native English speakers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second problem is the lack of empathy with the reader (or,
in initial stages, with the editor and reviewers). When
describing a Brazilian study in the international literature, the
author must be sure that the text is intelligible to a reader
from outside Brazil. This applies to specific issues, such as,
for instance, explaining why minimum wages are used to measure
family income, or detailing the location and characteristics of
the geographical area where the study was conducted. This applies
also to more general issues: what would be the interest of an
international journal in publishing a Brazilian study? Answering
this question requires a discussion of the external validity of
the study, including a thorough characterization of the studied
population, and speculation as to whether these results would or
not be generalizable to other contexts. Brazilian studies often
show advantages in relation to surveys conducted in the North,
such as the possibility of studying diseases or exposures that
are specific of poor populations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third issue is format. Every editor likes to receive
articles that rigorously follow the journal's manuscript
preparation norms. For instance, whether the abstract must be
structured or unstructured, the information to be included in the
front page, reference format, section titles, among others.
Editors do not like to receive manuscripts that seem to have been
previously submitted to and rejected by other journals, and then
submitted to their journals without alterations in format. Of
course, any editor of a journal that is not absolutely first tier
will be aware that many of the manuscripts submitted to him or
her have been previously refused, but it is essential to reformat
the manuscript specifically to the journal to which it is being
submitted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still regarding format, the size of the article is an
important issue. In general, editors prefer to publish short
articles, since this allows for the inclusion of a greater number
of articles into a fixed number of pages. For cultural reasons
that are beyond the scope of the analysis article, it seems that
authors of Latin origin tend to be unduly prolix, at least from
the Anglo-Saxon perspective. This leads, for instance, to
extremely long introduction and discussion sections, and often to
exceeding the word limit recommended by the journal. This may
prove a fatal mistake, since the editor may have doubts about the
appropriateness of sending such a long article for review, often
opting for immediate refusal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most high-quality international journals currently refuse over
90% of manuscripts immediately, without external review. Editors
reach this decision very fast, without reading the entire
article. Criteria for this decision include the apparent quality
of the article (partly based on writing and format, but also on
methodology and length), its presumed interest to the journal's
readership, and, without doubt, the articles authors; authors who
are known, or affiliated to renowned institutions are undoubtedly
more likely to pass this initial evaluation. In the
aforementioned survey, a colleague spontaneously referred that
"<i>the problem is not being Brazilian, it's being unknown</i>."
It is unquestionable that editorial prejudice may important for
the immediate selection of articles to be sent for review.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Editors usually start by reading the manuscript's cover
letter. This letter is often underestimated by authors, but this
is actually the best opportunity the author has to convince the
editor that his or her article is appropriate for that journal.
It also provides an opportunity to argue how a study carried out
in Brazil may contribute to international literature. The editor
then proceeds to reading the abstract and methods. After reading
these three items, it is possible to decide whether the article
should or not be sent to external reviewers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  it is important to consider the formal aspects of the article, and to show empathy 
  with the target audience, if one whishes to publish in Northern journals. The 
  personal experience of the present first author is that, after an author becomes 
  experienced and well known, the percentage of refusals drops rapidly.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>WHERE TO PUBLISH?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When commissioning the present article, the editors of the
<i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> mentioned that
"<i>maybe you could also discuss the issue of different
readerships for different scientific productions, in other words,
what type of study is aimed at the national public and what
research could be of interest to international readers. It seems
to us important to eliminate the false and simplistic notion that
robust research should go to international publications whereas
poor research is destined to the internal public.</i>" This is a
complex, multidimensional issue, which has undergone profound
change in recent years. When deciding on where to publish,
authors must consider the following issues:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Language 
    and target audience</i>. When submitting a manuscript, it is important to 
    consider the target audience for the results at hand. For example, the evaluation 
    of a Brazilian health care program must be published in Portuguese, given 
    its importance for decision making in this country. Not with standing, a good 
    evaluation is also of interest to the international public &#150; the Mexican 
    <i>Programa de Educaci&oacute;n, Salud y Alimentaci&oacute;n</i> (PROGRESA), 
    for instance, which inspired the Brazilian <i>Bolsa-Fam&iacute;lia</i>, has 
    been the object of high quality evaluations,<sup>7</sup> which, if restricted 
    to the Mexican public, would have little or any access to readers of other 
    countries. The same is true for the study on revaccination (REVAC), recently 
    published by a Brazilian group.<sup>8</sup> A solution for this problem are 
    journals that offer bilingual publication, such as is currently the case with 
    the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Type of contribution 
    to knowledge</i>. When a Brazilian study produces highly relevant results, 
    its authors will normally attempt to publish them in a high-impact international 
    journal in order to reach a wider public. On the other hand, confirmatory 
    studies of associations that are previously known but which need to be replicated 
    in our settings are more appropriate for national journals.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Generalizability</i>. 
    Studies investigating predominantly biological outcomes, which can more easily 
    be generalized to other contexts, are appropriate for international publication. 
    On the other hand, studies of the prevalence of health-related problems within 
    our population, evaluations of national services or programs, or studies of 
    inequities in health are of more local interest. In contrast with those of 
    basic science, the results of research in the field of public health tend 
    to be highly dependent on the local context, and are therefore more appropriate 
    for national journals.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Citation 
    indexes</i>. Unfortunately, the citation indexes of Southern journals are 
    still low when compared to the majority of international publications. Since 
    this is an important evaluation criterion for our post-graduate programs, 
    there is a strong incentive for publication in international journals. In 
    the field of public health in Brazil, this problem is not as impeditive, since 
    the two major Brazilian journals in this field are considered as international 
    for evaluation purposes. However, in other fields of knowledge, this is an 
    important incentive to publish abroad.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Publication 
    speed</i>. There is widespread belief that the publication of articles in 
    national journals is slow, frequently taking over a year, whereas in international 
    journals this would be a more agile process. We are unaware of comparative 
    data that confirm such a difference. Another point in favor of sending articles 
    to first tier international journals is that, due to the large number of submissions, 
    rejection is almost immediate for most articles, the author thus wasting less 
    time when compared to journals in which the majority of manuscripts are forwarded 
    to external review, and in which refusal may take months to be formalized. 
    Journals such as Lancet include a "fast track" option, which reduces time 
    between submission and publication to less than a month. However, this option 
    is restricted only to extremely innovative articles. Brazilian journals could 
    consider such a possibility as an incentive to high-quality articles.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Open access</i>. 
    A great advantage of national journals is open access to published work, which 
    is not the case for a large number of international journals. There is growing 
    pressure to expand open access; for instance, the National Institutes of Health 
    and the Wellcome Trust no longer allow articles generated by research financed 
    by them to be published in restricted access journals.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, the decision regarding where to publish is complex,
and depends on the factors mentioned above. With the
dissemination of electronic and bilingual publications, this
issue is evolving rapidly towards a reduction of the distance
between national and international journals.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present commentary we have discussed the marked
imbalance, in international scientific journals, between research
originating from scientists from the North and the South. We have
shown that there is a generalized perception among Brazilian
researchers that such imbalance is due at least partly to
prejudice of international editors against Southern authors,
which is supported by the fact that a very small percentage of
editorial board members of international journals come from the
South. Although prejudice can explain part of the imbalance,
there are also specific measures that may increase the likelihood
of a paper from the South being accepted in international
journals. These include the need to invest in the quality of the
written text, and to show empathy with editors and readers,
emphasizing the contribution of the manuscript to the
international literature. Finally, we discuss whether research
carried out in the South should be published in national or
international journals, and suggest that there are at least six
dimensions to this choice. These include language and target
audience; type of contribution to knowledge; generalizability;
citation index; speed of publication; and open access. The rapid
growth in the number of Brazilian contributions to the
international health literature shows that editorial prejudice,
although often present, can be effectively offset by research
with solid methodology and good-quality presentation.</font></p>
