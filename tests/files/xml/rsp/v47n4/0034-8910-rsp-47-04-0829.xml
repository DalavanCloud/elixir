        <p>Academic evaluation has been an essential component of modern science since its
          inception, as science has moved away from personalized patronage toward its contemporary
          role as an essential enterprise of contemporary, democratic societies. In recent years,
          Brazil has experienced sustained growth in its scientific output, which is nowadays fully
          compatible with its status as a high middle-income country striving to become a fully
          developed, more equitable country in the years to come. Growth usually takes place amidst
          challenges and dilemmas and, in Brazil as elsewhere, academic evaluation is not exempt
          from such difficulties. In a large, profoundly heterogeneous country with a national
          evaluation system and nationwide on-line platforms disseminating information on the most
          disparate fields of knowledge, the main challenges refer to how to pay attention to detail
          without losing sight of comprehensiveness and how to handle social and regional diversity
          while preserving academic excellence as the fundamental benchmark.</p>

      <title>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</title>
      <p>The need to evaluate what has been produced under the aegis of different funding sources is
        as old as the emergence of Modern Science itself. In its beginnings, evaluation was
        basically defined as a system of obscure (in the eyes of the public) rewards and vetoes
        applied to findings that might please or challenge the status quo and the points of view of
        nobles and priests, as clearly illustrated by Galileo Galilei’s trial. <xref ref-type="fn"
          rid="fn1">
          <sup>a</sup>
        </xref>
      </p>
      <p>The long and winding road between the emergence of Modern Science in Galileo’s times and
        our own age is characterized by:</p>
      <list list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>the definition of people who carry out research as “scientists” as late as 1834 (in the
            case of the English language) by the Rev. W. Whewell (1794-1866). Whewell was an
            influential thinker in the era of Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and John Snow (1813-1858),
            so the very word “scientist” emerged at the same time as modern biology and
            epidemiology;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>the gradual replacement of doing research under the aegis (patronage) of a given
            member/circle of the clergy/nobility or on behalf of a given state <xref ref-type="fn"
              rid="fn2">
              <sup>b</sup>
            </xref> by the alternative perspective of doing science “supported” by public agencies,
            understood, to a large extent, as an independent task pursued by individual
            scientists/research groups;</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>the establishment of societies, institutions and agencies with the explicit aim of
            promoting science and debating its concepts and findings. One cannot imagine French or
            British science without institutions like the French Academy of Science, founded in
            1666, or the Royal Society, in 1660 (about the latter, see a review of its major
            achievements in its first 350 years in Bryson). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

      <title>SCIENCE AFTER WORLD WAR II</title>
      <p>Science as we know and practice it – as a large, regularly funded complex set/network of
        individuals and teams, institutions and dedicated journals, supported by public agencies and
        private foundations in the context of democratic societies – gained momentum after World War
        II, in what is usually known as “big science” (a term coined by Alvin Weinberg (1915-2006),
        an American physicist and science manager).</p>
      <p>In Brazil, big science was born with the initiative launched by Brazilian physicists to
        establish stable, well-endowed institutions to foster science on a “big scale”. <xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
          <sup>1</sup>
        </xref> Of course, the practical effects of such a quest for big-scale science in Brazil
        should not be compared with the huge amounts of money invested in science by governments and
        foundations from richer countries, such as the US government and US-based foundations.
        Nevertheless, such efforts resulted in the creation, in 1951, of the <italic>Conselho
          Nacional de Pesquisa</italic> (National Research Council), later renamed as
          <italic>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</italic> (National
        Council for Scientific and Technological Development).</p>
      <p>The systematic support and accreditation of graduate and postgraduate programs dated from
        the 1970s, when Coordination for Enhancement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES –
          <italic>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</italic> ), until then
        defined as a “campaign” <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">
          <sup>c</sup>
        </xref> (what in English would be roughly the equivalent of a taskforce) became a permanent
        institution and launched its regular evaluations of graduate courses.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>WHAT DO EVALUATIONS MEAN, WHAT DON’T THEY</title>
      <p>Evaluation of academic work aims to assess the intrinsic value of research from the
        perspective of peers; to make science and its technological applications and social impacts
        accountable to governments and tax payers; and to provide guidance for policymaking in any
        area of societal life which may interact with science &amp; technology (what might be
        roughly coincident with contemporary life in a broad sense; but see Feynman <xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
          <sup>5</sup>
        </xref> on what he called our “unscientific” age).</p>
      <p>Some of the problems, frustrations and anxiety scholars and students feel respecting
        evaluation are secondary to (mis-)expectations. For instance, as a teacher and former
        coordinator of a graduate program, I heard many times that evaluations at the national level
        should include assessments of individual classes/teachers. Desirable and sorely needed as
        such specific assessments might be, they are clearly local and focal, and by no means
        compatible with a comprehensive cross-evaluation of dozens of programs in each given area,
        nationwide. In this sense, evaluations should be multiple and should take place on different
        scales, varying from those targeting local concrete experiences to broad national
        assessments.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>THE DISUNITY OF SCIENCE AS A CHALLENGE TO INTEGRATED EVALUATIONS</title>
      <p>We are used to speaking of Science with a capital S, as such capitalized Science could
        muster aims, methods and procedures across the most different disciplines. “Disunity of
        science” is an expression coined by the American physicist and historian of science Peter
        Galison <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">
          <sup>d</sup>
        </xref> to document the fact different disciplines have boundaries, are propelled or
        hindered by different, idiosyncratic forces, and use methods and procedures tailored to
        their specific aims.</p>
      <p>Brazil has a national evaluation system and a nationwide on-line curricula vitae (CV)
        platform (unified as the Lattes platform <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">
          <sup>e</sup>
        </xref> ), unlike other large federative countries, such as the US and Germany. The
        Brazilian system roughly resembles Canadian funding institutions in terms of profiting from
        unified, on-line CV platforms. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">
          <sup>f</sup>
        </xref> But key differences should be highlighted here: Canada is much less populated and
        heterogeneous (in both social and geographical terms) than Brazil, and its on-line systems
        cover specific areas, such as research on health. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">
          <sup>f</sup>
        </xref> On the other hand, Canada is a bilingual country, what asks for English and French
        versions of every single document. Both differ markedly from the topical nature of US-based
        institutions and agencies (compare, for instance, the specificity and conciseness of the
        National Institutes of Health “eRA Commons” biosketches <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">
          <sup>g</sup>
        </xref> with Brazilian or Canadian comprehensive CVs).</p>
      <p>Brazil’s challenge is enormous and comprises the need to accommodate the demands of the
        most different sciences and disciplines, varying from the most abstract ones, such as
        philosophy and theoretical physics, to empirical sciences, such as most research carried out
        in the field of public health or engineering, as well as properly handle the pronounced
        heterogeneity of its institutions, society and geographic regions.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>FOCUSING ON PUBLIC HEALTH</title>
      <p>In a critical review of scientometrics in public health, Coimbra Jr. highlighted its
        comparatively low impact ( <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> frontier science) and its contextual
        and applied nature (his analysis focused on Latin American scientific output). <xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
          <sup>3</sup>
        </xref> The author is right in his criticism and his proposals toward broader and more
        “applied” criteria of scientific relevance. Not as a coincidence, fierce battles shake every
        single field of knowledge from time to time over the attribution of “Qualis scores” to
        journals, as listed at the CAPES webpage. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">
          <sup>h</sup>
        </xref> From my own perspective, any stable consensus regarding such scores would rather
        reflect coercion than consensus. So, controversy (sometimes harsh) tend to (re)emerge here
        for ever and ever, but this is the price Brazilian academy will always pay to have a unified
        national evaluation system across different disciplines, graduate programs, and
        localities.</p>
      <p>In a similar way, on-line CV platforms seem to be condemned to be on the wing, pulled from
        one side towards conciseness and practicality and from other side towards comprehensiveness
        and capacity to accommodate different activities and demands. The recent incorporation by
        CNPq of a brand new module to Lattes platform on the dissemination of science seems to be a
        compromise between the straightjacket of peer review and the need for scientists to
        disseminate to the society at large using language as free of jargon and technicalities as
        possible. The many different books written by Richard Feynman on physics and computation for
        non-specialists remain paradigmatic in terms of scientific soundness combined with clarity
        of exposition and conciseness, even when he focused on what he called “not-so-easy” pieces.
        Of course, to demand from all of us to be as talented and didactic as Feynman would push it
        too far. But maybe the sharp criticisms he published on teaching and doing physics in
        Brazil, as he observed first-hand during his sabbatical at the <italic>Centro Brasileiro de
          Pesquisas Físicas</italic> (CBPF), in the early 1950s, <sup>i</sup> may help us to better
        integrate academic excellence, academic teaching and the dissemination of science to the
        public at large.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think non peer-reviewed publications (such as reports in newspapers or television,
        blogs or posts in the web) could ever replace peer-reviewed articles. They should, rather,
        complement and foster a dynamic dialogue with them. Peer-reviewing is far from perfect, as
        has been discussed in the most different forums, many of them launched by the editors of
        peer- reviewed journals themselves. But I do agree with a recent comment by the German
        researchers and editors Maerthens &amp; Baethge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
          <sup>6</sup>
        </xref> [that] peer-review is “flawed and under-researched, but the best we have”. In the
        same way, democracy has many flaws and caveats, but for those who once lived in
        dictatorships it seems to be well defined in Winston Churchill’s famous quotation: “[…]
        democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried”.</p>
      <p>Examples of proper and improper uses of the most different media in their attempts to
        disseminate science are so numerous, conflicting and confusing that any attempt to base
        evaluations on such examples are not likely to reach any valid conclusion or even a
        provisional agreement. On a personal note, I remember here the positive influence of the
        Brazilian journal on popular science “Ciência Hoje” <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10">
          <sup>j</sup>
        </xref> (launched in 1982), from which I have learned so many wonderful things about science
        (especially about fields I will never have the expertise, time or talent to explore), over
        many years.</p>
      <p>On the negative side, I think any Brazilian citizen minimally concerned with science and
        their country should read about the defamatory newspaper campaign launched by a powerful
        group of <italic>Academia Nacional de Medicina</italic> against Carlos Chagas in the early
        1920s. Lacking any compromise with scientific integrity, a group of renowned physicians
        launched against Chagas – the most distinguished biomedical scientist of that period, as
        well as against his landmark discovery (later on, named after him as Chagas’ disease) –
        personal insults as well as biased criticisms. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11">
          <sup>k</sup>
        </xref> Such examples, so close to our own efforts as biomedical researchers, is a clear
        warning that any evaluation should be as comprehensive as possible, always comparing and
        contrasting different evidence and perspectives. There is no magical solution, no easy fix…
        as regarding civilization itself (as pointed by Sigmund Freud). Any evaluation will generate
        as a necessary corollary “its discontents”. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12">
          <sup>l</sup>
        </xref>
      </p>
      <p>I would like to conclude this article with an example from a field of research which is
        situated so far from my own field of expertise and from research published by
          <italic>Revista de Saúde Pública</italic> that at first sight it may seem pure nonsense.
        Anyway, without some unusual ideas science remains stalled.</p>
      <p>Living and working in the UK in the period I submitted these comments to <italic>Revista de
          Saúde Pública</italic> , I began to read in that same period a book published by the
        American theoretical physicist Lisa Randall. After reading the accolades that usually
        embellish the back covers of books and are so many times mistaken, I decided to browse her
        homepage at Harvard and then entered the Scopus database to double-check what Lisa Randall
        designated in her CV as “recent and highly cited papers” <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13">
          <sup>m</sup>
        </xref> (after all, epidemiologists are a kind of scientifically-endorsed gossipers). In the
        Scopus database, I realized that, as of May 30, Dr. Randall had been cited by 14,511 indexed
        papers. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14">
          <sup>n</sup>
        </xref> Curiously, such a hard-nosed scientist, dealing with abstract concepts and
        sophisticated mathematics has authored two books on popular science (one of them, the book
        that launched my quest for additional information [ <italic>Knocking on Heaven’s
          Door</italic> ]), contributed to many different newspapers and blogs, radio broadcasts,
        and – most surprising – wrote a libretto for an Opera. Definitively, Dr. Randall never
        attended the classic debates which took place repeatedly in our graduate forums, where wars
        are waged against “the highly cited scientists who have alienated themselves from real life
        problems”.</p>
      <p>I think it’s time to turn old prejudices upside down and realize that old dichotomies (such
        as the one between “ivory tower intellectuals vs. people who care about life as it really
        is”) are not as simple as people would like to think. Maybe such overly simplistic contrasts
        should instead be viewed upside-down, as in the funny sentence from Feynman (who was a bongo
        drummer and played in Rio de Janeiro’s samba schools), introducing one collection of his
        lectures on physics: “It is odd, but on the infrequent occasions when I have been called
        upon to play the bongo drums in a formal place, the introducer never seems to find it
        necessary to mention I also do theoretical physics.” (Feynman, 1992, p. 13). <xref
