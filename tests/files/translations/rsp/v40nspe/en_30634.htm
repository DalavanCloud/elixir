<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To recognize the characteristics and path taken by the through analysis of the 
  scientific production it has published over the period from 1967 to 2005.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> 
  Scientometric methods were used to analyze reference data on the articles published 
  in the Revista, retrieved from the databases ISI/Thomson Scientific (Web of 
  Science), National Library of Medicine (PubMed) and Scientific Electronic Library 
  Online (SciELO).<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> 
  The Revista is the only Brazilian publication in the field of public health 
  that is indexed by ISI/Thomson Scientific. It is prominent as a medium for publishing 
  Brazilian scientific production in public health and is displaying a geometric 
  increase in publication and citation, with annual rates of 4.4% and 12.7%, respectively. 
  The mean number of authors per paper has risen from 2 to 3.5 over recent years. 
  Although original research articles predominate, the numbers of reviews, multicenter 
  studies, clinical trials and validation studies have been increasing. The number 
  of articles published in foreign languages has also increased, accounting for 
  13% of the total, and the leading countries originating these are the UK, USA, 
  Argentina and Mexico. The number and diversity of journals citing the Journal 
  has been increasing, many of which are non-Brazilian. Authorship per author 
  shows good fit to Lotka's Law, but the parameters suggest greater concentration 
  and less dispersion than would be expected. Among the fields of interest of 
  published papers, the following topics account for more than 50% of the total 
  volume: infectious-parasitic diseases and vectors; health promotion, policies 
  and administration; and epidemiology, surveillance and disease control.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> 
  The Revista shows great dynamism, without signs of abating or reaching a plateau 
  any time soon. There are signs of progressively increasing complexity in the 
  studies published, and more multidisciplinary work. The Revista seems to be 
  widening its outreach and recognition, while remaining faithful to the field 
  of public health in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Revista 
  de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> is reaching its fortieth anniversary distinguished 
  as one of the leading journals in the field of public health in Brazil. In fact, 
  preliminary analysis of the data from the project "Characterization of Postgraduate 
  Programs in Public Health in Brazil",<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  in which all the scientific production from postgraduate lecturers within this 
  field that is registered in the Thomson Scientific database (formerly ISI, the 
  Institute for Scientific Information) up to 2005 is being studied, places the 
  <i>Revista</i> as the first choice for the publication of their work. In this 
  analysis, it has been seen that, with regard to indexed journals in that database, 
  these authors concentrate the publication of their work in seven journals, which 
  alone account for one-third of the production from this group of authors:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This group of journals 
  has been identified as the hard core of publications from postgraduate lecturers 
  in public health, by applying Bradford's Law.<sup>1</sup> This predicts that, 
  among the set of publications within a scientific discipline, the numbers of 
  journals in the first, second and third terciles of production obey an order 
  of 1:n:n<sup>2</sup>. The records in the aforementioned project include 4,842 
  publications and the Bradford sets have been identified in a ratio that is close 
  to the theoretical prediction: 1:n:n<sup>1.8</sup>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bradford's theory was among the first contributions towards
originating scientometry, a scientific discipline that is well
established today. From the middle of last century onwards, it
became greatly boosted through procedures for bibliometric
analysis, thanks to the consolidation of the records relating to
scientific production, on a regular basis. In the present
article, bibliometric records are analyzed with a view to
offering a portrait of the scientometric base for these forty
years of the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Revista</i> has had its publications registered in the
MEDLINE database of the National Library of Medicine, in the
United States, since 1967; in the Social Science Citation Index
and the Web of Science, since 1982; and in SciELO (Scientific
Electronic Library Online), an initiative coordinated by
BIREME-PAHO/WHO (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health
Sciences Information) and by the <i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o de
Amparo &agrave; Pesquisa do Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo</i>
(Fapesp - State of S&atilde;o Paulo Research Foundation), since
1977. On the basis of the records in the Web of Science,
MEDLINE/PubMed and SciELO, it was sought to characterize the
<i>Revista</i> over the period from 1967 to 2005, according to
the patterns of:</font></p>

  methodological procedures for the analysis will be presented together with the

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is the MEDLINE/PubMed 
  databases that gather together the greatest quantity of information on the articles 
  published by the <i>Revista</i>: there are records of 2,540 documents of different 
  types, of which 20 were in 1967 and 146 were in 2005. <a href="#fig1">Figure 
  1</a> shows the scatter of the annual numbers of items published over this period, 
  and also a curve fitted using the least-squares method as a suggestion for the 
  inferred behavioral pattern.</font></p>
<p><a name="fig1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634f1.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The curve suggested 
  in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> has a good fit (R<sup>2</sup>=0.89) and is described 
  by the following function:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634x1.gif"></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">in which the parameters indicate, respectively:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">24.64: The <i>Revista</i> 
    started by publishing around 25 articles per year;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">0.044: It has 
    been growing geometrically at a mean rate of 4.4% per year;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1967: The initial 
    year was 1967, i.e. the counting of time started with that year (t<sub>0</sub>=1967)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the 
  classification by types of publication in the PubMed database, scientific articles 
  account for 92% of all types of documents published, but by examining the trends, 
  it can be seen that, over more recent five-year periods, other types have progressively 
  gained space in the <i>Revista</i> (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="fig2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634f2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the same period, 
  the PubMed records also make it apparent that, despite the predominance of the 
  Portuguese language (87% of the total), both Spanish and English have been increasing 
  the participation over recent years, as shown by <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>. 
  It should be noted that, in its electronic format, the <i>Revista</i> has also 
  been published in the English language since 2003.</font></p>
<p><a name="fig3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634f3.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Web of Science 
  records, the countries of origin of the authors of documents published by the 
  <i>Revista</i> can be ascertained. Over the period from 1982 to 2005, there 
  were a total of 2,241 publications, of which 2,231 have valid records of their 
  country of origin. By dividing this period into five-year periods, the information 
  presented in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t1.gif">Table 1</a> is obtained. Similar information 
  can also be obtained from SciELO for the period 1997-2005, but preference was 
  given to the Web of Science because of its broader coverage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Reach and repercussion</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also from the Web 
  of Science records, the behavioral patterns of citations of articles published 
  by the <i>Revista</i> can be ascertained. Among the 593 journals in the field 
  of "General Social Sciences", within which the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> 
  is indexed, it is ranked 238<sup>th</sup> in numbers of citations, although 
  it is 577<sup>th</sup> in numbers of citations per article. These statistics 
  relate to May 2006 and are available under the heading "Essential Science Indicators", 
  in which data relating to the previous ten years plus the current year are analyzed, 
  with updating every two months. The Web of Science presents information processed 
  as five-year periods, as shown by the data in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t2.gif">Table 
  2</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An examination 
  of the annual citation rates for the articles published since 1982 suggests 
  a tendency towards each article resulting in two citations, as shown in <a href="#fig4">Figure 
  4</a>.</font></p>
<p><a name="fig4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634f4.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By examining <a href="#fig2">Figure 
  2</a>, from the most recent years to the earlier years, it can be seen that 
  this mean rate of two citations per article is achieved after around five to 
  seven years after publication. For the last ten years and the year 2006, the 
  consultation of the Web of Science in May 2006 registered 1,312 citations for 
  1,044 articles, this giving a ten-year rate of 1.26 citations per article.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, with the implementation of the "Essential Science
Indicators", the ISI/Thomson Scientific database has restricted
the calculation of the impact factor (number of citations of the
articles published over the last two-year period divided by the
number of articles published during this two-year period) to the
so-called Science Edition of the Journal Citation Reports (JCR).
Until then, the impact factor for journals in the Web of Science
- Social Sciences database appeared in the JCR, and the
<i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> registered an
impact factor of around 0.35 citations per article.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the impact factor for the <i>Revista</i> can be
gauged from the SciELO database, which was implemented with
pioneering participation from the <i>Revista</i>. There, in a
consultation in May 2006, the current impact factor found was
0.1038, using a two-year calculation basis, and 0.1333, for a
three-year basis. Taking the two-year impact factors in a
historical series, figures ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 were found. It
was noted that, although the impact rates originated from
different data collections, they converged towards similar
figures, thereby suggesting the strong inductive inference that
this is a fair measurement of the <i>Revista</i>'s
performance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In SciELO, in the 
  same way as previously done by JCR, there is the additional information of calculations 
  of the half-lives of citations (the time taken for 50% of the total number of 
  citations to occur, or the median of the age of the citations). At present, 
  the half-life is 6.38 and, from examination of the historical series, it was 
  observed that it ranged from four to eight years. Again, this information is 
  consistent with the citations register in the Web of Science, which was analyzed 
  in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>, and this suggests that after around ten years, 
  all the citations expected have been concluded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  now offering statistics on 158 indexed journals with the same quality as in 
  the Web of Science, SciELO also offers free access to each of them in digital 
  files. Any edition of the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> can 
  be freely consulted, from 1977 up to the present date, and PubMed offers a link 
  for such consultations. This, together with the growing share of articles in 
  the English language (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), establishes the conditions 
  needed for an increase in its reach and progressive growth in its citations. 
  Just as in the production, the numbers of citations have also grown exponentially, 
  as suggested by <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>.</font></p>
<p><a name="fig5"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634f5.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By fitting the 
  function suggested by <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> to the data (note that 2006, 
  which is still incomplete, has been disregarded because it is aberrant), an 
  excellent fit is obtained (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97) for an exponential function 
  of the following form:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634x6.gif"></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">in which the parameters, as in the case of the production,
indicate respectively:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.52: The <i>Revista</i> 
    started with around five citations per year;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">0.127: The numbers 
    have been increasing geometrically at a mean rate of 12.7% per year;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1971: The <i>Revista</i> 
    started to be cited in 1971.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is worth noting that the growth rate for citations is more
than twice the growth rate for production. This suggests that, in
addition to vegetative growth resulting only from the increase in
the numbers of articles published and their citation yield (two
per article published), the growth in citations can be attributed
to other factors. Among the candidates for such explanatory
variables are both the progressive increase in texts in English
and the greater ease of access provided by SciELO.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sources of citation of the <i>Revista</i> today differ
from those of its early years. The first five-year period with
records in the Web of Science (1982-1986) allows the citation
pattern to be ascertained: there were 553 citations distributed
among 112 journals. Over the last five-year period (2002 to
2006), because of the long half-life there were only 238
citations, but these were distributed among 136 journals. The
final five-year period has around half the number of citations
seen in the first five-year period, but still has practically the
same number of citing journals: in the first five-year period
there were 4.9 citations per citing journal, and 1.75 in the
final period. This degree of concentration would be greatest if
equal to the number of citations (all citations in the same
journal) and least if equal to one (each citation in a different
journal). From the first to the last five-year period there was a
reduction in concentration of 64.3%, such that the last five-year
period is only 35.7% of the first, i.e. 2.8 times lower in
concentration or, said in another way, 2.8 times greater
outreach.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the Web of Science records, it can also be ascertained
which journals made these citations of the <i>Revista de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>. To find out about these while
taking into account the passage of time, the period beginning in
1971 was divided into decades up to the present date, with the
fourth decade starting in 2000. Since it is not possible to list
all the journals that have already cited the <i>Revista de
Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>, a selection method has to be
determined. Taking into consideration that, during the first
decade, six journals registered at least two citations of the
<i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>, it was established
that these six would be identified. For the subsequent periods,
the quantity of journals registering at least two citations of
the <i>Revista</i> grew prohibitively, which called for a
different cutoff method that still respected the cutoff rationale
established for the first decade. Given that, according to the
number of citations, the hierarchy of citing journals had a
Pareto distribution, it was defined that the number of citing
journals to be presented for each period would be proportional to
the dispersion parameter of a Pareto function fitted to the data
in each period. Thus, independent of the number of journals,
those with the greatest contribution were selected for
highlighting, according to the characteristics of the period. The
Pareto probability density function is a continuous asymmetrical
function that can roughly be imagined as the right half of a
normal distribution curve, and it has the following form:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the purposes 
  of its application here, it can be simplified to the following description:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634x3.gif"></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">in which the parameters 
  c and a represent, respectively:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634x4.gif"></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>c</i>: frequency 
    level that indicates the first place among citing journals;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>a</i>: shape 
    of the distribution, describing its decay rate or dispersion. For <i>a</i>=0, 
    the distribution curve results in a horizontal straight line from the initial 
    level, while for <i>a</i>=8, the curve results in a straight line that descends 
    abruptly before reaching the second rank in the hierarchy. Between these values, 
    the curve has a fairly smooth shape reminiscent of the right half of a normal 
    curve.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consequent to defining 
  this methodological strategy, <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t3.gif">Table 3</a> shows 
  the statistics on the citations of the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> 
  and <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t4.gif">Table 4</a> lists the journals highlighted 
  in the four periods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Authorship</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the 2,540 articles 
  registered in the PubMed database, 4,575 authors were found, who wrote between 
  one and 128 articles for the <i>Revista</i>. In bibliometry, the number of authors 
  for an article is an indirect measurement of its complexity, if conditioning 
  factors of another order such as possible authorship due to comradeship are 
  ignored in principle. Over this study period of almost 40 years, the <i>Revista</i> 
  has shown a year-by-year progressive increase in the mean number of authors 
  per article, consistent with what is a universal trend of growing complexity 
  in scientific investigations (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="fig6"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634f6.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since each article 
  may have more than one author, the 4,575 authors gave rise to 8,104 authorships. 
  The canons of scientometry state that the distribution of authorships among 
  authors within a given field of scientific production follows Lotka's Law.<sup>3</sup> 
  According to this theory, which is also called the inverse-square law, 60% of 
  authors would have only one authorship and this proportion would decrease strongly, 
  inversely to the square of the number of authorships. Thus, authors with one 
  authorship would represent 60%, with two authorships 15%, and so on, in accordance 
  with the following function:</font></p>

  fitted to the <i>Revista</i>'s production data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99) takes 
  on the following form:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634x6.gif"></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This configuration of the distribution of authorships suggests
that the <i>Revista</i>'s community of authors is eclectic, given
the large proportion of authors with only one article published
(75%, or 25% greater than the 60% expected by Lotka's Law) and
the narrow variability (2.5, or also 25% greater than the 2
expected by Lotka's Law: the greater the exponent is, the lower
the variability and the flatter the curve are).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ninety-three percent 
  of the authors of the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> are authors 
  with only one, two or three contributions. Although this large proportion of 
  authors with a small number of publications suggests a lack of any parochialism 
  in the <i>Revista</i>, this must also be considered in the light of the field 
  of knowledge that it serves. Pedrosa,<a href="#back2"><sup>**</sup></a> studying 
  the scientific production of postgraduate lecturers in a sample from all the 
  programs accredited by <i>Coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o de Aperfei&ccedil;oamento 
  de Pessoal de N&iacute;vel Superior</i> (Capes - Coordination for the improvement 
  of higher education personnel), found that a Lotka function fitted to these 
  data also suggested a large concentration of authors with few publications: 
  69% of the authors recognized through the Web of Science records had only one 
  authorship and the dispersion was less than expected (the exponent of the denominator 
  of the Lotka function was 2.24).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By consulting the 
  Web of Science database, the institutional authors that have contributed most 
  to the <i>Revista</i> can be determined (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t5.gif">Table 
  5</a>). It is worth noting that there has been a progressive reduction in the 
  proportional participation by the <i>Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> (USP 
  - which hosts the <i>Revista</i>), giving room for other institutions, such 
  as the <i>Universidade Federal de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> (Unifesp), which had 
  tripled its participation by 2005. The <i>Universidade Estadual de Campinas</i> 
  (Unicamp) had a regular participation in the three periods; the <i>Universidade 
  Federal de Pelotas</i> (UFPel) started to appear in the 1990s and proportionally 
  increased its participation in the 2000s; the State Health Department of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo and its research institutes dropped out of the top ten institutions in 
  terms of proportional participation in the 2000s, while the <i>Universidade 
  Federal da Bahia</i> (UFBA) recovered its position that had been lost in the 
  1990s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Topics of interest</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To classify the topic of interest of a publication, the Web of
Science allocates each journal registered in its database to a
certain field of scientific knowledge. This is a rough
classification that fits each item published by a journal into a
large field, in accordance with the scope of topics of the
journal. The <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> is
classified in the field of "Public, Environmental &amp;
Occupational Health". This type of classification is greatly used
in scientometric studies and allows profiles to be determined for
scientific production in given fields of interest. For example, a
study on Brazilian scientific production over the period from
1981 to 1995<sup>4</sup> enabled the identification of physics,
biology and biochemistry, clinical medicine, engineering,
chemistry and plant and animal sciences as the fields of
knowledge that were most prominent within Brazilian science. For
the present study, for which the field of interest was one
journal, this classification was of no help for characterization
purposes. For this reason, it was necessary to resort to the
keywords of the articles published. Both the Web of Science and
PubMed include keywords for each bibliographic item registered in
their databases, although they do this distinct ways that do not
necessarily agree.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analysis of keywords is recognized as inadequate for
characterizing publications. It finds better application for use
in database searches with the purpose of identifying articles
dealing with similar subjects. Even for this purpose, its
performance is modest. Over the last few years there has been
some progress towards overcoming these limitations by means of
conceptual structure recognition techniques in scientific texts.
One initiative of this type, the technique from Collexis5, a
German company that provides services for the World Health
Organization (WHO - Alliance for Health Policy and Systems
Research), and for some journals such as those from the publisher
Elsevier, have been the subject of investigations and tests by
BIREME/SciELO. This technique recognizes a "fingerprint" in every
word of a given text: a root that concords with a Thesaurus of
specialized terms, from which it classifies the degree of
intensity with which this fingerprint is recognized in the
text.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These reflections are necessary because, to analyze the topics
of interest in the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>,
only the keywords can be made use of in analyses, among the data
available, and caution is required in any interpretation of the
information derived from these keywords.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To analyze the keywords in the articles published by the
<i>Revista</i>, those registered by PubMed were chosen, given
that this database covers the whole period of existence of the
<i>Revista</i>. Among these keywords, interest was restricted to
the "MeSH Major Topics", which are keywords at the highest level
of aggregation that supposedly best represent the content of each
article. "Supposedly", because although something like
"<i>Creatinine/*urine</i>" would represent a high level of
aggregation (a study on creatinine in the urine, without
clarifying the purpose), it still denotes a specific aspect of
the study, not a general characteristic. For 2,540 publication
items that were recorded in PubMed for the <i>Revista</i>, 4,719
key words of "MeSH Major Topic" type were identified, which in
PubMed are highlighted by an asterisk. These 4,719 keywords were
used in 6,466 valid cataloging records (non-empty) for published
items (a mean of 2.55 keywords per article: minimum of 0, maximum
of 8, mode =2), of which only 842 had at least two occurrences
per five-year period of existence of the <i>Revista</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 842 keywords 
  accounted for 2,589 records of MeSH Major Topics, a volume that when distributed 
  in a contingency table according to the <i>Revista</i>'s five-year periods showed 
  a non-random distribution (Fisher exact test; p=0.000). Residual analysis<sup>5</sup> 
  on this contingency table allowed identification of 557 records of 508 different 
  MeSH Major Topics that characterized the <i>Revista</i>'s five-year periods 
  by statistically significant associations. Since this was still a very large 
  volume for reporting in the present study, the MeSH Major Topics were recoded 
  in a discretionary manner into 11 study categories, thus resulting in what is 
  presented in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t6.gif">Table 6</a> below, and summarized 
  in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Placing the keywords into categories according to type of
study for the present study involved arbitrary judgment, and
readers' tolerance of this is requested, given that exhaustive
description of the 557 "MeSH Major Topics" would be prohibitive,
both because of their extensiveness and because of the difficulty
in interpretation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>COMMENTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the 40 years of the <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica</i>, it has exhibited significant dynamism, as
suggested well by functions (1) and (2). Following the criticism
of the Malthusian model of exponential growth, the expectation
that there has been for dynamic models describing natural
phenomena is that, at some point, any growth would come up
against a limit and that the intrinsic nature of the phenomenon
would prohibit the surmounting of this limit. It would therefore
be expected that, after the long period of 40 years, the growth
in the annual number of publications and citations would already
have reached its natural limit and that the function that
described its dynamics would be asymptotic to this limit.
However, the <i>Revista</i> still does not show any behavior
suggestive of stabilization that would allow it to be argued that
it might some day find a limit to its growth. The technological
revolution that today allows articles to be published in the form
of digital files that are accessible through the Internet has
broken through the narrow limits of an economic and logistical
nature that previously restricted the publishing of journals on
paper. The <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>
is still published in both forms, but today there are exclusively
electronic journals and the future for journal publication seems
to point in this direction. This may come to pass, and perhaps
the growth limit for publications within a field of knowledge may
one day come to be the exhaustion of that field's capacity to
produce knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growing complexity 
  of the studies published (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>), allied with the characteristics 
  of function (3), suggests multidisciplinary work in the context of the articles 
  published by the <i>Revista</i>. In fact, these characteristics suggest that 
  authors from other fields of knowledge may be present in the <i>Revista</i>'s 
  articles as collaborators with public health authors: multidisciplinary teams 
  that are needed to cope with public health studies that are progressively more 
  complex. Even if the high concentration of authors with few studies published 
  is considered to be a result from the characteristics of the field of public 
  health, as duly signaled in the results, it cannot be neglected that the parameters 
  of function (3) suggest that the <i>Revista</i> has a greater concentration 
  of authorship or, expressing this in another way, greater diversity of authors, 
  than in the cited study by Pedrosa<a href="#back2"><sup>**</sup></a> on this 
  field. The growth and diversification of citing journals (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t3.gif">Tables 
  3</a> and <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t4.gif">4</a>) reinforces the idea of greater 
  coverage, complexity and diversification.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The numbers of 
  items published in English and Spanish have increased (<a href="#fig3">Figure 
  3</a>) and both the types of documents published (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) 
  and the sources of citation of the <i>Revista</i> (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30634t4.gif">Table 
  4</a>) have diversified, although the same cannot be said regarding the types 
  of studies. Looking at <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>, the impression is that 
  the topics of infectious-parasitic diseases and vectors; health promotion, policies 
  and administration; epidemiology and disease surveillance and control; mother-child 
  health; demography, mortality and morbidity; and nutrition have notable participation 
  in the <i>Revista</i> that is regular and stable, and which has varied little 
  over the five-year periods analyzed. However, proportional growth can be highlighted 
  for, on the one hand occupational health and social, anthropological and economic 
  studies (with progressive increases over recent years) and, on the other hand, 
  ecological and environmental studies (with initially erratic appearance but 
  subsequent regular increases in proportional participation over more recent 
  five-year periods).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As signaled in the text, this information on types of study
requires caution in ite interpretation. The factors limiting the
faithfulness of the <i>Revista</i>'s portrait that are
highlighted are the restriction of the analysis only to the MeSH
Major Topics, the arbitrary reduction of these to the ones with
two or more presences per five-year period, the subsequent
reduction of the latter to those with statistical associations
with the five-year periods, and finally the arbitrary
categorization by type of study. The only excuse for tolerating
so many provisos is that, otherwise, any analysis would have had
to be abandoned.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other respects, 
  the results have to be examined while taking their sources into account. The 
  data analyzed originated from three distinct sources: PubMed, Web of Science 
  and SciELO. These databases are independent and cover different periods and 
  aspects of the classification of a publication. They are not necessarily concordant 
  and may even diverge in the numbers of articles recorded for the <i>Revista</i> 
  over a given period. In fact, some items cataloged by the Web of Science as 
  "Item about an individual", "Book review", "Correction, addition", "Editorial 
  material" and even "Article" are sometimes not found in PubMed, and vice versa. 
  The classification of documents differs from one bibliographic database to another: 
  here, the PubMed database was utilized (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) because 
  it has the greatest coverage, albeit without this ensuring greater faithfulness. 
  With regard to the citations, it should be remembered that these relate exclusively 
  to the Web of Science database, which explains the absence of <i>Cadernos de 
  Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>, a journal published by <i>Escola Nacional de 
  Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> (ENSP - National Public Health School) and a 
  sister publication of <i>Revista de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i> in the family 
  of Brazilian public health publications.</font></p>
