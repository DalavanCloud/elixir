<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To study trends of dissertation and thesis production in workers' health in 
  Brazil.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> 
  Observation units were dissertations and theses developed by Brazilian researchers 
  in national and foreign graduate programs. Theses and dissertations were identified 
  in previously compiled works, LILACS and Capes database. Search keywords were 
  workers' health, ergonomics, occupational hygiene, toxicology, and occupational 
  health.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> 
  There were identified 1,025 documents. Of them, seven were published before 
  1970, 31 were published in 1970s, 121 in 1980s, 533 in 1990s, and 333 between 
  2000 and 2004. An exponential growth of studies during the study period was 
  observed with a corresponding factor approximately equal to 4 in each decade. 
  The majority of studies addresses major public health issues like musculoskeletal 
  diseases, mental health, and occupational risks for health workers. It was noticeable 
  the small number of studies on unemployment, occupational cancer, and primary 
  sector and construction industry workers, known as a risk group for fatal work-related 
  injuries.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> 
  The growth of public and collective health graduate programs was a major factor 
  for increasing research on workers' health in Brazil in recent years. Despite 
  increasing academic studies in this area of knowledge there are some persisting 
  gaps persist that need to be narrowed in the near future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relationship between work and sickness is recognized as
important part of human life and culture. The use of means for
preventing work-related injuries has been described as early as
in the Bible, in Deuteronomy XXII:8: where window sills are
recommended when building up constructions to prevent falls.
However, when addressing the knowledge on workers' health is
impossible not to mention the Ramazzini's seminal
work<sup>70</sup> developed from the end of the 17th century and
beginning of the 18th century, which constitutes a valuable piece
on occupational diseases, and first suggested the inclusion of
specific questions on occupation into the clinical history,
anticipating approaches to prevent and treat diseases, such as
musculoskeletal conditions, still prevalent. However, the
prevention of work-related injuries and other health problems
became known only after the emergence of the social medicine
paradigm in the 19th century, which allowed the recognition of
working conditions as a major determinant of life
conditions,<sup>75</sup> an association masterly illustrated by
Engels in his study on the daily life of workers in
England.<sup>30</sup> Knowledge on this subject has flourished in
the 20th century, not only driven by the scientific development
of medicine and public health but also by the advances of the
so-called technology fields such as safety engineering,
occupational hygiene, toxicology and ergonomics. It leaded to the
occupational health model creation in consonance with public and
collective health paradigm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first descriptions and documentations of workers' health
conditions in Brazil date from the 19th century<sup>33</sup> but
only much later it was a matter of research in medical schools.
Former theses on occupational medicine in academic settings were
developed in the old forensic medicine chairs, whose scientific
interests included studies of occupational risks, work conditions
and injuries. However, theses and dissertations focusing major
national workers' health problems flourished only after the
exponential growth of graduate programs in Brazil in 1990s. Few
studies have addressed the academic production such as the list
published by Mendes,<sup>58</sup> and the Mendes &amp;
Waissman's<sup>57</sup> review study on occupational health
history in Brazil. Kirchoff,<sup>43</sup> in her doctoral thesis,
outlined the evolution of the scientific production on workers'
health but her data was limited to the period between 1990 and
1994. So far, little is known on the quantitative evolution and
contents of thesis and dissertation developed on workers' health.
The present study aims a further understanding of the pathway of
Brazilian researchers' academic production in workers' health up
to 2004.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The scope of the present study was the academic production in
workers' health focusing on theses and dissertations developed by
Brazilian researchers in Brazilian and foreign academic
institutions. Documents were selected from several literature
sources, such as the catalogue of theses and dissertations
registered from 1950 to 2002 by Mendes.<sup>57,58</sup> This
author has searched references of them in private files,
libraries and records from academic and health research
institutions across the country. He was helped by researchers and
graduate professors who provided him with lists of theses and
dissertations references from each graduate program in the field
of collective health, toxicology, ergonomics and engineering in
Brazil. In addition, a search was carried out in the LILACS
database (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health
Sciences) and the <i>Coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o de
Aperfei&ccedil;oamento de Pessoal de N&iacute;vel Superior</i>
(Capes - Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education
Personnel) thesis catalogue for the period between 2003 and 2004.
As the query on 2005 data showed a small number of entries,
suggestive of incomplete data update, the end of the study period
was thus defined as the year 2004. Although the list of theses
and dissertations published by Mendes<sup>58</sup> is limited to
citation data, the analysis of the contents was possible since
the abstracts were made available. The subject of each thesis and
dissertation was identified by its title and abstract and
classified in groups to facilitate the analysis. Given the large
amount of material available, detailed examination was limited to
the most common research subjects or to subjects representing
historical landmarks of trends and innovations. Duplicated
references were manually identified and excluded. Some references
not related to workers' health were also excluded.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS AND 
  DISCUSSION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Mendes<sup>58</sup> catalogue there were identified 864
theses and dissertations between 1950 and 2002. A duplicate and
three documents whose subjects were out of the scope of this
study were excluded, remaining 860 for analysis. From Capes and
LILACS database, after duplicate documents were excluded, 158
documents from 2003 and 2004 remained and added to the study. A
total of 1,018 theses and dissertations were examined in this
study. It was not possible to identify all documents produced
before 1950 because they were not included in any available
database. From 1950 to 1970 seven theses and dissertationswere
found and 31 during the 1970s. In 1980s the amount of these
documents increased four times, reaching a total of 121
documents. This exponential trend remained throughout the
following decade (n=533) and apparently remains unchanged during
the present decade, although only part of the data were available
as for the first five years (n=333). This sustained increment
reflects the growth of graduate programs in collective health and
the increasing interest of most graduate students on workers'
health. Formal research groups registered in the <i>Conselho
Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e
Tecnol&oacute;gico</i> (CNPq - National Council for Scientific
and Technological Development) also show an increase of main
stream research on workers' health from 2000 to 2004. Besides the
positive impact of graduate courses, well established research
programs and high qualified faculties and researchers are also
key elements to understand the increasing amount and quality of
theses and dissertations on this subject-matter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Historical background</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The history of knowledge on the relations between work and
health can be appreciated through theses and dissertations,
especially in those periods when research studies were rarely
published in journals. Mendes &amp; Waissman<sup>57</sup> (2003),
in their pioneer literature review on the historical background
of work-related diseases in Brazil, reported that the earliest
theses showed negative results. In the author's words "there was
not found any case of illness in this factory that could be
described as peculiar,"<sup>59</sup> despite the plausible
presence of occupational exposures in the studied industry of
cigars and sniff tobacco factories in the city of Rio de Janeiro.
Another study<sup>36</sup> investigated the health status of
workers and residents in a neighboring area of an animal-fat
processing plant that produce candles and soap because it was
hypothetised that health problems could possibly arise from the
fetid odor released, which was consistent with the miasma theory,
popular at that time. It should be highlighted the advanced
perspective underlying this study by taking into consideration
the simultaneous occupational and environmental impact of a given
industry. However, as in the previous study, no evidence of
occupational diseases was found.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These mentioned studies have introduced in Brazil the
discussion on the relationship between living and working
conditions, assimilating ideas that were under debate in Europe
at that time, and that gave origin to the social medicine. In
Brazil, consolidated abolitionist movements were the expression
of major humanistic aspirations in Latin America, and some
studies sought to depict life conditions of enslaved black
populations including their working conditions.<sup>33</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mendes &amp; Waissman<sup>57</sup> (2003) recognized the key
role of J&uacute;lio Afr&acirc;nio Peixoto in establishing the
foundations of the knowledge on workers' health when he took
office at the chair of forensic medicine in both medical and law
schools in Rio de Janeiro in the beginning of last century. From
his dedication to studies of occupational risks and related
accidents and diseases, many publications were released. It was
also reported that, in 1922, Leon&iacute;dio Ribeiro wrote his
associate professor thesis on hernia and work-related injuries,
as part of studies on forensic medicine developed in Rio de
Janeiro. A similar process occurred in S&atilde;o Paulo, where,
also as part of academic activities of the chair of forensic
medicine, important compendiuns such as "Tratado sobre acidentes
de trabalho" (The work-related injuries), were developed by
Afr&acirc;nio Peixoto, Flam&iacute;nio F&aacute;vero, and
Leon&iacute;dio Ribeiro.<sup>67</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, in 1934, the first reports of inspections in workplaces
whose reports started to be presented in national and
international meetings, and published in journals such as the
<i>Boletim do Departamento Nacional de Pesquisa Mineral</i> (DNPM
- Bulletin of the National Department of Mineral Research) by the
Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy.<sup>15</sup> Physicians
working for the Brazilian Ministry of Labor were also involved in
pioneer studies on workers' health as well as investigators of
Oswaldo Cruz Institute Division of Industrial Hygiene in the
1940s.<sup>33</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their review, Mendes &amp; Waissman<sup>57</sup> (2003)
acknowledged a DNPM's study as one of the first epidemiological
studies on workers' health in Brazil. Approximately 1,009 gold
miner workers were examined and prevalences of silicosis of
11.82% and of tuberculosis of 8.7% were estimated. The author
could make a causal occupational inference comparing populations
with similar socioeconomic status.<sup>15</sup> The observed
association between silicosis and tuberculosis, previously
described by LaDou,<sup>46</sup> had a great impact in Brazil and
was widely disseminated in scientific meetings at that time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maeno &amp; Carmo<sup>50</sup> (2005) reviewed historical
aspects of workers' protection policies in Brazil and underlined
the critical role of some authors like Bernardo Bedrikow. In
1950s, in partnership with the <i>Servi&ccedil;o Social da
Ind&uacute;stria</i> (SESI - Social Service of the Industry),
Bedrikow<sup>14</sup> coordinated a large survey on access and
delivery of medical care and occupational hygiene services in the
city of S&atilde;o Paulo. From an industry census database, 2,137
companies were selected which corresponds to 72,782 workers.
Occupational exposures and occupational or work-related diseases
and health care provided or available to this population were all
assessed. Bedrikow called attention to the clinical care nature
of the health services provided, the lack of a preventive
orientation, and a poor facilities infrastructure as well. In
1950s, occupational medicine was introduced in medical school
programs<sup>57</sup> and there were major scientific meetings in
this field of study that certainly had stimulated former
observational studies developed as academic theses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Thematic analysis of theses and dissertations</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The oldest thesis identified in the present study was
developed by Mocellin<sup>62</sup> (1951), submitted to the
<i>Faculdade de Medicina do Paran&aacute;</i> (State of
Paran&aacute; School of Medicine), and addressed prevention of
occupational noise-induced hearing loss. From 1950 to the 1970s
most theses dealt with infectious diseases, such as leptospirosis
in sewage workers,<sup>51</sup> tuberculosis associated to
work-related risks and occupational diseases developed to the
<i>Faculdade de Direito do Vale do Para&iacute;ba</i> (Law
School) in 1966;<sup>20</sup> and the study on the prevalence of
toxoplasmosis according to occupational groups.<sup>38</sup> A
dissertation presented to the <i>Faculdade de Sa&uacute;de
P&uacute;blica da Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i>
(FSP-USP)<sup>39</sup> compared urine coproporphyrin in battery
workers of factories covered by preventive actions and those who
had not. This is one of the first scientific approaches for
evaluating workers' health programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30629t1.gif">Table</a> 
  shows the distribution of theses and dissertations by conclusion period from 
  1970 to 2004. In 1970s, work-related injuries was the most common subject studied 
  (n=5, 16.1%), focusing themes as injuries in small size firms,<sup>56</sup> 
  and naval construction.<sup>28</sup> From dissertations developed abroad, one 
  described occupational injury cases recorded in Brasil<sup>18</sup> and was 
  submitted at the University of London in 1977; a second one focused on the sociological 
  conception of work-related injuries and was submitted at <i>&Eacute;cole des 
  Hautes &Eacute;tudes en Sciences Sociales</i> in Paris in 1978.<sup>29</sup> 
  Unlike the preceding period, concern about work-related infectious diseases 
  was seen in only one thesis on Chagas' disease in rural workers that was submitted 
  at the <i>Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais</i> 
  (UFMG).<sup>32</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pioneer role of the FSP-USP became evident as it accounted
for one third of the dissertation and theses concluded in
occupational health in the 1970s (n=10), extensive to the USP
overall (n=17, 55%). The participation of the
<i>Coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o dos Programas de
P&oacute;s-Gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o em Engenharia da Universidade
Federal do Rio de Janeiro</i> (COPPE - Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro Coordination of Graduate Programs in Engineering) was
also noticeable for contributing with three dissertations, all of
them covering subjects related to ergonomics.<sup>60,83,88</sup>
The <i>Faculdade de Medicina da Unviersidade Federal da Bahia</i>
(UFBA), also contributed expressively with two dissertations on
lead poisoning.<sup>23,85</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The researchers' concern about non-industrial workers such as
garbage workers,<sup>81</sup> and drivers,<sup>19</sup> has
become evident as well as their interests about health problems
now recognized of great magnitude and relevance such as silicosis
and exposures to chemicals, either metals like mercury and lead,
or organic compounds such as pentachlorophenol, benzene and DDT.
The influence of the French school of sociology of work is
evident in Dwyer's<sup>29</sup> (1978) thesis on the social
concept of work-related injuries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1980s there 
  was a four-time increase in the number of theses and dissertations (121) compared 
  to the previous decade (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30629t1.gif">Table</a>). Whereas in 
  the 1970s most studies were of epidemiological or quantitative nature, in 1980s 
  studies started to deal with theoretical issues or the social or political contextualization 
  and integration of research themes (n=16; 13.2%). This approach is exemplified 
  by Possas<sup>68</sup> (1980), Goldbaum<sup>37</sup> (1981), Murolo Filho<sup>64</sup> 
  (1981), Costa<sup>27</sup> (1982), Lacaz<sup>44</sup> (1983), Fachini<sup>31</sup> 
  (1986) and Sev&aacute; Filho<sup>78</sup> (1988) dissertations and theses, among 
  others. A few qualitative studies on workers' perception<sup>17,24</sup> and 
  the first studies on gender, work and health<sup>1,47</sup> were also conducted 
  during this decade. A dissertation addressed child labor in agriculture in the 
  state of S&atilde;o Paulo<sup>5</sup> anticipating a subject-matter that became 
  a priority only in the first years of this new millennium. In addition, the 
  first study on occupational health care was developed in this period. Early 
  studies were developed at nursing schools<sup>6,84</sup> and mainly addressed 
  nurse's practice and training in occupational health. The first dissertation<sup>34</sup> 
  addressing health care workers was developed at that time, a subject that became 
  the most studied in theses and dissertations focusing one single professional 
  group in the 1980s (n=8) and 1990s (n=47), and accounted for 18% of all thesis 
  and dissertation concluded in the present decade. Teachers was also a subject 
  of study in 1980s though still limited to nursing teachers.<sup>54</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It can also be noted that, differently from the 1970s when
most studies focused on one specific disease, injury or a
particular group of workers in a firm, the scope of workers'
health changed in the 1980s and evolved to large analytical
categories, such as absenteeism or even social inequalities,
sometimes using sophisticated epidemiological analysis as seen in
the Rummel<sup>76</sup> (1987) study. Rummel addressed the
healthy worker effect as an evidence of social exclusion, earlier
regarded as only a methodological artifact. Also, in this same
decade, theses and dissertations on workers' health were
developed in schools not related to the health field, such as the
<i>Faculdade de Arquitetura e Urbanismo</i> (School of
Architecture and Urbanism)<sup>40,53</sup> and <i>Instituto de
Geoci&ecirc;ncias</i> (Institute of Geosciences) at the
<i>Universidade Estadual de Campinas</i>
(Unicamp).<sup>78</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The number of dissertations and theses continues its
exponential growth. In the 1990s, it reached a total of 533, 18
times the number seen in the two previous decades. In 1991, a
dissertation highlighted the underreporting of work-related
injuries,<sup>11</sup> followed by several studies on the
information systems or even the nurse's perception of reasons for
occupational diseases and accidents underreporting.<sup>65</sup>
Following the pathway opened in the previous decade, studies on
transmissible diseases and work have gained a macrosocial
dimension when dealing with, for instance, the relationship
between malaria and the process of land use in
Rond&ocirc;nia,<sup>16</sup> or the so-called enhanced chemical
accidents.<sup>35</sup> There were also several studies on the
involvement of workers' organizations, such as unions, in
workers' health.<sup>4,42,45,55,74,82,90</sup> It can also be
noted increased number of studies on work-related chronic
conditions, such as mental diseases, arterial hypertension,
cardiovascular risks, musculoskeletal symptoms and diseases, and
in the embryo development characteristics from pregnant workers.
Rehabilitation of injured workers, still a challenge in
occupational health in Brazil and worldwide, was taken as the
subject of a dissertation.<sup>86</sup> Studies on health
providers were also increasing, especially those focusing on
nursing practice, mostly carried out in nursing schools but also
in graduate programs in collective health. Several aspects have
been explored: job turnover,<sup>6</sup> biological and chemical
risks, work-related injuries, musculoskeletal
symptoms,<sup>2</sup> hepatitis B,<sup>12</sup> but mainly stress
and psychiatric disorders,<sup>52,61,72</sup> among others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 360 theses and dissertations
was found, lower than expected given the trend of previous
decades. This can indicate a delay in the update of databases
utilized in this study or terminological changes in the
classification. In general, study contents follow the same trend
seen earlier. The great focus of research was health care workers
s, especially nurses common diseases, such as mental health
problems, musculoskeletal symptoms and diseases, ergonomics,
biological and chemical risks and needle stick-related injuries.
Based on few studies developed in the past decade, research on
technology advances, computerized work and work
management<sup>7,10,13,41,63</sup> as well as environment-based
management systems have multiplied.<sup>3,87</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poor working conditions, informal job contracts and
outsourcing<sup>8,77</sup> have also proliferated as
subject-matter taken by these studies. Research on occupational
dentistry especially involving the relationship between exposures
at work environment and oral health<sup>48,79,80,89</sup> has
been developed following the first research conducted in
1998.<sup>9</sup> Two studies were identified that evaluate
work-related injuries into the perspective of urban
violence,<sup>21,49</sup> an approach influenced by the
increasing violence and itsimpact into workers' daily life, that
leads this issue to be recognized as a public health priority.
Among other social aspects scarcely explored in previous decades,
a thesis dealing with racism and racial discrimination in
workers' health was identified. Preliminary studies, however, had
addressed jobs where Black prevails such as housekeeping and
construction.<sup>25</sup> In addition, it could be noted studies
focusing on management systems of workers' health integrated to
environment services following recent recommendations by the
International Work Organization and the World Health
Organization.<sup>69,73</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides the identified exponential growth, some time trends of
contents could be noted throughout the study period: there was an
absolute and relative increase of theses and dissertations on
musculoskeletal diseases (around 50%), mental diseases (100%),
especially among health care workers (72%, data elsewhere), and
other conditions or outcomes such as obesity, fatigue, aging, and
vocal disorders, among others, rarely described in former
decades. It is worth mentioning the decreased absolute and
relative frequencies of theses and dissertations on injuries and
silicosis, which are severe common occupational health outcomes.
Noise and hearing loss, which have been addressed since 1950s
when the first thesis was developed, remained the focus of
studies at a stable proportion in spite of being a common
disabling problem, especially in the manufacturing
industries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It can also be noted that in the present decade there is a
better regional distribution of theses and dissertations
throughout Brazil with increased proportional participation of
Midwestern, Northern and Northeastern states and consequently an
increased number of institutions developing research projects.
Also most publications have been developed in public
institutions.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL COMMENTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the scientific knowledge in workers' health
resulting from graduate theses and dissertations has started
shyly in 1950s as part of the infectious disease research stream.
It has geometrically grown in the following decades mostly driven
by the development of graduate programs, showing during the
following decade an exponential increase by a factor of four.
First concentrated in the Southern and Southern regions, from
1990s it has spread to the Northeastern, Northern and Midwestern
regions, including almost all Brazilian states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides their growth and spread to all regions of Brazil, the
variety and groundbreaking subjects addressed by theses and
dissertations on workers' health are remarkable as well as their
approach to problems known to have significant public health
impact. It is worth noticing that, besides more traditional
aspects, the academic activity, from its very beginning, focused
on themes of little visibility in the scientific literature such
as occupational risks in small size firms,<sup>56</sup> garbage
workers,<sup>81</sup> prostitution<sup>22</sup> and child
labor.<sup>5</sup> Also, in the 1980s, studies have been
conducted on occupation and reproductive effects focusing women
work,<sup>47</sup> and social participation in the health
management and policies.<sup>66</sup> In the following decades,
the Brazilian graduate studies covered a variety of subjects,
always aware of problems regarded as public health priority.
There appear to be differences in the priorities addressed by
theses and dissertations and abstracts presented in scientific
meetings, according to the review of Rego et al<sup>72</sup>
(2005). These authors found that the most common research issues
were work-related diseases and injuries, and most frequently they
comprised descriptive studies dealing with specific conditions
such as intoxications, cumulative trauma and mental disorders.
The occupational categories most often studied were health,
education and agriculture.<sup>71</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The studied dissertations 
  and theses revealed some knowledge gaps as exemplified by the small number of 
  epidemiological studies on occupational determinants of cancer. Throughout more 
  than five decades only six theses and dissertations could be found on that subject, 
  and no studies targeting cancer prevention, case record systems or the public 
  health burden was identified. It is surprising considering the significance 
  and magnitude of the Brazilian academic research on cancer. The lack of studies 
  about workers from the primary sector, such as those engaged in agriculture 
  and livestock, recognized as having high risk of severe health problems, is 
  also remarkable. This could be explained by the fact that these workers are 
  difficult to reach and there is a few funding sources and limited resources 
  available for workers' health research in Brazil. At the same time it stresses 
  the need for more attention from research support agencies and institutions 
  in charge of policy development in the field of workers' health. Despite the 
  relevance of construction due to the extended number of workers engaged in this 
  activity and the burden of fatal work-related injuries related to this economic 
  activity, few studies addressed this issue. Unemployment, known as causing numerous 
  health problems, has not been studied in theses and dissertations, as well as 
  the economic and social impact resulting from disease costs and the burden of 
  occupational injuries. There were also very few studies on the evaluation of 
  the effectiveness of prevention programs, especially of successful interventions, 
  which seems to reflect some degree of hopelessness and skepticism in regard 
  to the role of prevention, that may contribute to the pessimistic viewpoint 
  pervading activities such as the training of workers' health professionals. 
  One recognized successful policy in the field of workers' health is the prohibition 
  of child and adolescent labor in high-risk occupations,<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
  a subject not yet sufficiently addressed in recent theses and dissertations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One limitation of the present study was the fact that it was
mostly based on existing lists of theses and
dissertations<sup>57,58</sup> since it was not possible to carry
out a comprehensive search and using a rigorous methodological
approach to ensure the coverageof all eligible documents.
Moreover, it was not possible to consider all keywords indicated
in each thesis or dissertation, therefore the themes were
classified and categorized by the author. The Capes database did

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since most scientific knowledge generated on workers' health
is not published by indexed journals or made easily accessible,
this study, besides the understanding of general research trends
allows for an enhanced dissemination of this important research
products. It is possible that the scientific knowledge on
determinants of occupational diseases and work conditions has
contributed to the declining trends of fatal work-related
injuries and several occupational diseases almost
worldwide.<sup>26</sup> In Brazil, despite the large number of
academic studies on workers' health, it is remarkable that only
recently, research has become well appraised and applied as
evidence in the decision making processes of institutions engaged
in policy development and program management. Greater integration
between researchers and policy makers and managers is further
needed in order to allow the use of knowledge for more
appropriate action to improve the workplace and workers'
environment health.</font></p>
