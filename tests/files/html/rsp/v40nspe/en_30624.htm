<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An analysis was made of the path taken by social sciences
within health in Latin America, on the basis of scientific
production achieved, especially in Brazil. The work is divided
into the following sections: introduction; notes on the origins
of the field; scientific reviews; the 1990s and studies on
scientific production; previous review articles; and final
comments. This study recounts the historical path taken by
scientific production, using extensive documentation:
bibliographic surveys, bibliographic studies and review articles.
The topics surveyed within this field and some data on the
professionals who work in these activities are highlighted. In
the conclusions, emphasis is given to the great vitality of the
field, which in just a few decades has attained importance within
the scientific scene.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The social sciences within health originated little more than
five decades ago, yet they have developed in distinctly different
ways, with regard to the conditions that allowed them to emerge
and develop in European countries, the United States, Canada and
Latin America. Their origins have determined the different topics
covered and also their alignment with a wide diversity of
theoretical-conceptual reference points. The objective of the
present study was to describe some features that are pertinent to
scientific production within this field in Latin America,
particularly Brazilian production.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ORIGIN OF THE 
  SOCIAL SCIENCES WITHIN HEALTH</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In analyzing the origins of the social sciences within health
internationally, authors have been unanimous in affirming that
this field began to take shape following the end of the Second
World War.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although important antecedents exist, the concerns regarding
the social sphere were expressed in the light of the problems
faced by European countries and the United States during the
economic, political and social reconstruction. This time, which
was crucial in delineating the social sciences, was analyzed in a
precise manner by the Gulbenkian Commission for the Restructuring
of the Social Sciences (1996).<sup>35</sup> Three developments
that profoundly affected the structure of the social sciences
after 1945 were highlighted: changes in the world's political and
economic structure with the strengthening of the United States
and its relations with the Soviet Union; expansion of production
and population (from 1945 to 1970); and expansion of the
university system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within this panorama, health emerged as a prominent
sociological topic when significant funds were allocated to
sociomedical research. With regard to the United States, some
events deserve highlighting: in 1951, Parsons published his work
on medical practice; in 1954, the first doctoral-level course was
created, at Yale; and in 1960, medical sociology was accepted as
one of the section of the American Sociological Association. From
that time onwards, the social sciences took on an important role,
as shown by the increasing numbers of new courses opening and
journals, books and articles being published. A space formed by a
web of relationships between institutions and researchers was
thus set up, which has extended until today (Nunes,<sup>28</sup>
1999).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In European countries and in the United States, the role of
social sciences was crucial in delineating a field of
investigations that included the development of health-related
topics, while in Latin American countries, health was brought
into the social sciences later on.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The social sciences, and particularly sociology, gained
currency in Latin America between the 1930s and 1950s, a time
when foretokens of a concern regarding health were seen, although
this developed separately. In Brazil, the creation of the
<i>Escola de Sociologia e Pol&iacute;tica</i> (School of
Sociology and Politics) in 1933, and the <i>Faculdade de
Filosofia, Ci&ecirc;ncias e Letras</i> (School of Philosophy,
Sciences and Literature) of <i>Universidade de S&atilde;o
Paulo</i>, in 1934, were mileposts in the development of social
thinking and research, albeit without taking on the question of
health as a topic for a long time. Thus, delineation of the
scientific production within the social sciences allows distinct
periods to be identified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For Latin America the divisions adopted are: from 1880 to
1930, characterized by bacteriological and parasitological
research connected with the problems of agricultural export
production; from 1930 to 1950, when basic and clinical research
linked to hospital development was conducted, in parallel with a
large boost to the process of industrialization; from 1960 to
1970, when a renaissance in tropical medicine related to
agricultural and livestock production was seen, along with the
beginning of studies on health services addressing the need to
rationalize and reduce the expenditure in this sector by
Brazilian states (Garc&iacute;a,<sup>17</sup> 1981). It was only
in the 1970s that a more systematic development of social studies
within health could be observed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were precursors, such as Nogueira,<sup>27</sup> the
author of the first sociological study on disease, in this case
tuberculosis, which was published in 1950. Some anthropologists,
such as Charles Wagley (1913-1991) and Kalervo Oberg (1901-1973),
arrived in Brazil at the end of the 1930s and became associated
with projects in the field of health in the 1950s. Wagley came to
this country by invitation from the National Museum and, in 1939,
took charge of the Sanitary Education Division of the
<i>Servi&ccedil;o Especial de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica</i>
(SESP - Special Public Health Service).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1933, Castro<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  conducted a survey on the living conditions of the working classes in Recife, 
  which was the first study in this topic in Brazil. However, as has occurred 
  with the classical studies within sociology, the classical Brazilian studies 
  did not adopt medicine and health as specific research topics.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1960s, Freyre<sup>15</sup> (1967) dealt with the
sociology of medicine, and biocultural discussions were common in
his work, as evaluated by Bertolli Filho (2003).<sup>4</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, starting with scattered contributions that appeared over
the course of the 1950s and 1960s, the social sciences
encountered propitious ground for more systematic development
that followed pedagogical trends, and also through the research
activities of the first social scientists and their first
publications in this field. During this period, in Central
American countries, projects related to nutrition were
incorporating anthropologists and sociologists.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The situation was totally different in the United States,
which at the end of the 1960s had more than a thousand
investigation projects underway and more than two thousand
researchers in the fields of the economics and sociology of
health. In parallel, in Latin America, the reorganization of
economic and social policies in the 1960s gave rise to the
utilization of social sciences as an analytical tool in
formulating development plans.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>REVIEWS OF THE 
  SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Latin America, the first analyses of the scientific
production within the social sciences date from the end of the
1960s, when the first survey of such production was made.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Badgley &amp; Schulte<sup>2</sup> (1966) identified concerns
about questions of social science teaching and educational
development in 41 publications; research on socialization and
family organization in 33 references; the term "social
epidemiology" in 33 studies; 24 demographic studies; and around
22 studies on community and social change. These authors drew
attention to the fact that the studies identified were limited to
investigations of the relevance or application of concepts and
techniques from behavioral sciences, to studies on health and
disease and on medical teaching.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, over the course of the 1960s, with regard to health, the
Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and some foundations in
the United States turned towards analyses of the economic
presuppositions that could interfere in the adoption of public
health measures and in the formulation of methodologies for
health planning. It was from this time that the single-cause
theory was perceived to be incapable of explaining the complex
relationships between the population's living conditions and its
diseases, and multiple-cause explanations started to be sought.
Approaches from social psychology were also brought in during
this period, especially in relation to the problems of training
and educating human resources.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the second half of the 1970s, studies advanced in their
understanding of the health-disease process, through the
utilization of a reference point that went beyond the
multiple-cause explanation: the social causes of diseases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the other hand, studies sought to understand medical
education as a process related to broader social processes, for
example in the study by Garc&iacute;a<sup>16</sup> on medical
education at the end of the 1960s, which was published in 1972
within a Marxist approach.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1970s was also marked by studies on important topics such
as the organization of health practices and the health-disease
process, taking social science approaches as their basis. Some
authors like Mercer (1986)<sup>24</sup> pointed out a
characteristic common to doctors and social scientists: the need
to report, understand and contribute towards solving the
medical-social problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Mercer<sup>24</sup> (1986, p. 24): "Overwhelming
social causes made distortion and concealment useless and placed
any analysis within a dimension in which individual or group
behavior would be insufficient as an observational and
explanatory criterion". To establish such a criterion, criticism
of functionalist paradigms and the natural history model of
disease that were considered to be hegemonic in investigations in
the social-medical field were constructed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was the era of the student protest movements and the
university reforms. This criticism also sought to gain an
understanding of the growing inadequacy of medical care and
comprehend the social and economic conditions that constituted
this state of need and inequality in health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1972, a meeting sponsored by PAHO with participation by a
small group of social scientists and doctors, which was held in
Cuenca (Ecuador), brought the need for an alternative model for
social medicine into the debate. A model that would take into
consideration an analysis of the change and allow research on the
real situation in terms of its internal contradictions and
structural levels and their interrelations was sought. The
proposal to study the social organization of health practices and
the health-disease process as historical processes was the great
feature of the first postgraduate courses. Even today, the
production from this research, which was conducted within
carefully constructed theoretical propositions, forms a strong
reference point for the social sciences within health. As pointed
out by Carvalho<sup>12</sup> (1997, p. 60): "It was finally in
the 1970s that the social variables and macrostructural
approaches took over in the analyses on the health-disease
process, thereby requiring reconfiguration of the
technical-scientific agenda for health professionals".</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the process of institutionalizing the social sciences
within health was interlinked with the institutionalization
process within the field of public health via postgraduate
courses and projects. This took place with support from the
<i>Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos</i> (FINEP - Funding Agency
for Studies and Projects), especially in the 1980s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between 1986 and 1987, 136 investigative projects relating to
social sciences within health were funded by FINEP and by the
<i>Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas Cient&iacute;ficas e
Tecnol&oacute;gicas</i>, (CNPq - National Council for Scientific
and Technological Research), within the public health program
that was created in 1982 (Teixeira,<sup>33</sup> 1988). In an
analysis of these projects, Viacava et al<sup>34</sup> (1992)
identified that 74% of the projects (1987-1988) were in federal
and state universities located in Southeastern Brazil and that
61% of the researchers had training in public health, while 17%
had graduated in human sciences. This was because at the end of
the 1980s there was a drastic reduction in the resources destined
for investigations (Guimar&atilde;es,<sup>20</sup> 1993).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Badgley et al<sup>3</sup> (1980) presented 1,671 references
from the period 1950-1979, which were subsequently complemented
with a further 1,086 publications up to 1985 by
Nunes<sup>29</sup> (1985). In these reviews, the data were
grouped into four categories and various subcategories, with the
aim of verifying the movement in topics in this field. Thus, over
this 35-year period, the category of traditional medicine, an
important field in Latin America, represented around 18.4% of all
the production. It had a marked presence in the 1950s and 1960s,
while diminishing in the subsequent decades. The category of
health services represented 36.3% of the references, the
health-disease process 32.2% and human resources training 13%.
Starting in the 1970s, analyses of health practices showed that
the structural markers were coming closer together, thereby
seeking to go beyond their internal determinations, i.e. their
historical structural bases. This perspective was instrumental in
accomplishing studies on preventive medicine, community medicine,
health policies, relations with the State and health service
organization. An emphasis on the work market and health
professions emerged after 1980, as did the start of concerns
regarding social security and the pharmaceutical industry. It can
be highlighted that, in relation to the health-disease process,
original work from a theoretical-methodological point of view was
produced, thereby marking the beginning of postgraduate courses
in Mexico and Brazil. Nonetheless, studies continued to be
produced with a more conventional formulation regarding the
relationship between morbid processes and social and economic
variables, taken alone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Donn&acirc;ngelo<sup>14</sup> (1983; p. 31), from
the second half of the 1970s, the social sphere no longer
appeared in the scientific production relating to public health
in Brazil in the form of a variable added to the list of factors
causing diseases. Instead, it appeared as a structured field
within which the disease acquired a specific social significance.
Furthermore, the importance of work categories was highlighted in
the 1980s, through the study of certain professional categories,
women's work, work procedures, tiredness among workers and work
accidents. In the category of human resources, emphasis was given
to analyses of study plans, medical training and medical
students.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the First Brazilian Meeting for Social Sciences within
Health, in 1993, a workshop was held on the topic "The
contribution of social scientists towards constructing the field
of health". Out of the group of 15 participants, 12 presented
studies directed towards "thinking out the field", including
questions of a conceptual nature (Nunes,<sup>30</sup> 1995, p.
36). This was reflective analysis of epistemic nature that showed
the wide-ranging possibilities for sociological analysis: the
contribution of social sciences towards evaluating the risks in
chemicals; social movements and health; health professions;
gender studies; and health policies and health systems. These
studies furnished a view of how the field had been taking shape
over the years along theoretical trends that enriched the field
such that it became positioned at the same level as other fields
of interest relating to sociology, anthropology and political
science. A debate arose in the light of the crisis in the models
providing all-embracing explanations, and this led to the need to
study detailed social characteristics, subjectivity and the
construction of collective identities, through the utilization of
concepts that allowed mediation between structure and social
action. The restrictive nature of analyses on the relationships
between the State and health policies that were based on
structural-functionalist perspectives of Marxist nature was also
confirmed. The discussions turned towards the need to link the
macro and micro dimensions, together with restoring the
collective players. On the other hand, symbolic aspects of
diseases started to be studied through narratives relating to the
sick individuals. Professional pathways added studies of the
health professions to the field, especially regarding doctors,
thus completing the historical-social matters investigated
previously, in a trend of qualitative research
(Nunes,<sup>30</sup> 1995).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE 1990s AND 
  STUDIES ON SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was only at the end of the 1990s that another study
(Canesqui,<sup>11</sup> 1998) was published on the scientific
production relating to the social sciences within health. This
study was based on the topics and disciplines of interest of 158
professionals and gave a total of 196 items. The topics
highlighted were: health policies and institutions (29.0%);
health and society (11.5%); human resources (8.0%); planning,
management and assessment of health services (6.6%); social
movements and health (5.6%); education and communication in
health (4.0%); reproductive health, sexuality and gender (4.0%);
theory and methodology of research (3.7%); therapeutic systems or
alternative cures (3.7%); and violence and health (3.0%).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As in previous decades, it was seen that the social sciences
were structured in close relationship with the principal
socioeconomic problems and health policies. Canesqui<sup>11</sup>
(p. 141) showed that, at that time, there was "a tendency towards
specialization in the sphere of social sciences within health,
either around specific objectives or through attempts to
demarcate fields of disciplines that were, in turn formed by
specific topics carrying distinct epistemological and
methodological perspectives and distinct traditions". With regard
to the disciplines of interest, 5.0% of the respondents indicated
the history of diseases and public health; 4.5% sociology of
health or disease; and 3.7% medical or health anthropology.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1990s was a period of consolidation in the research
relating to social sciences, including new topics and an
increasing move towards research outside of the field of research
conducted within the sphere of postgraduate courses in public
health/collective heath. Gomes &amp; Goldenberg<sup>19</sup>
(2003), in a review on the meetings and congresses relating to
the social sciences within health that were held in 1993, 1995
and 1999, indicated that the topics and focuses were divided into
three areas:</font></p>

<ol><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
  <li> anthropology, 
    in which the continuation of topics linked to traditional practices was highlighted, 
    and specifically, the rationales embedded in these practices and in relation 
    to official medicine. The traditional practices that were designated the "traditional 
    systems" started to be referred to as "alternative practices" (p. 260);</li>
  <li> within the 
    scope of sociology, topics relating to decentralization, counseling, participation, 
    good citizenship and social movements that covered the period from 1993 to 
    1999 were highlighted, including the family health programs;</li>
  <li> with regard 
    to epidemiology, more than one-third of the studies presented related to the 
    health-disease topic with different approaches, highlighting the question 
    of the risk permeating the fields of social science and epidemiology, at varying 
    levels of complexity according to the field considered.</li></font>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another important point in analyzing the scientific production
relating to the social sciences emerged when the focus went from
the courses in the field of health to the field of social and
human sciences related to health. Among the few studies on this
production, the one by Marsiglia et al<sup>23</sup> (2003) can be
highlighted, which presented a survey of the material available
in the libraries of the <i>Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i>
(USP), <i>Universidade Estadual de Campinas</i> (Unicamp),
<i>Pontif&iacute;cia Universidade Cat&oacute;lica de S&atilde;o
Paulo</i> (PUC-SP) and the <i>Escola de
Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o de Empresas</i> (Business
Administration School) of <i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o
Get&uacute;lio Vargas</i>, S&atilde;o Paulo (FGV-SP). A total of
258 doctoral theses and master's dissertations produced between
1990 and 2001 were classified, and the supervisors of this work
were interviewed. The authors of this study considered that the
production of dissertations and theses during the 1990s was
"reasonable" and the origins of this work were: PUC-SP, 38%; USP,
36%; FGV-SP, 15%; and Unicamp, 11%. These work were produced
within courses in the fields of: administration, 19%; psychology,
18.2%; social services, 11.6%; education, 11.2%; anthropology,
politics and sociology together, 20.5%; history, around 6%; law,
around 5%; economics, around 5%; and geography, 3.1%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The topics of policies, institutions and service
administration were the subject of investigation in 31.4% of the
studies; 27.9% were on the health-disease process; 16.7% on human
resources training relating to health; and the emerging topics of
health and work, quality of life and environment appeared in
17.4%. Social movements were the topic dealt with least. The
authors established a parallel with the study by
Minayo<sup>25</sup> (2000) on the production relating to the
social sciences within health in the field of public health, and
found the same topics in the fields of public health and social
and human sciences: health policies and the health-disease
process. Although in third place in both situations, human
resources were dealt with proportionally more in social and human
sciences by the postgraduate students in administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to the interviews held with the supervisors, the
authors concluded: "the teachers who guided this work had had
contact with health questions in the field of public or
collective health or in preventive medicine departments shortly
before entering teaching and research institutions for social and
human sciences, or when they were already teachers in these
institutions. Some, however, had made their careers in
public/collective health and only later on had they started to
give courses in teaching and research institutions for social and
human sciences, particularly those in the field of
administration" (Minayo,<sup>25</sup> p. 283). The authors also
recalled that, in the fields of psychology and anthropology, the
interest in health and mental health already dated back some
time. Alves<sup>1</sup> (1999) and Canesqui<sup>10</sup> (2003)
have published detailed reviews on the production relation to
anthropology.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These works cited offer an overview relating to the scientific
production up to very recent dates. However, over the last decade
there has been a great diversification of topics, thus indicating
the need for an updated evaluated of this field.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nunes et al<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a> 
  (2005) began a more detailed evaluation of the professionals in this field, 
  with the aim of outlining their profile and indicating the topics on which they 
  were working. They presented the interim data from this evaluation, obtained 
  from 68 interviews.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>REVIEWING THE 
  COMPILATIONS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The principal compilations and some studies that offer an
overview of the field were reviewed. There were two prominent
compilations during the 1980s. One of them, organized by
Nunes<sup>31</sup> (1983), brought together important articles
from the literature: a text on the origins of medicine; a
classical article on health in cities and the first movements
within public health; a text giving critical coverage of the
currents within social thinking on health; another text on the
health-disease process as a social process; a discussion on the
relationship between alienation in work, stress and coronary
disease; and a compilation on primary medical care, which was a
very current topic at that time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second compilation, organized by Nunes<sup>29</sup> (1985)
was product of the Seminar on Social Sciences within Health that
was held in Cuenca (Ecuador) in 1983. This compilation includes:
the last work by Garc&iacute;a on the origins of the social
sciences in Latin America; a detailed review of the literature on
the social sciences within health produced in Latin America up to
that date; the path taken by national development of the social
sciences in Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela; the
disciplines within the field: anthropology, economics, social
psychology and sociology; the topics that these are divided into:
socioepidemiological studies, health services, education and
personnel training; and a section on epistemology.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The publication of some important compilations started in the
1990s, in substitution for the annals of the Latin American
congresses on social sciences within health, which were often
limited to summaries of the studies presented. These compilations
present most of these studies in their entirety.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first of these<sup>32</sup> resulted from the congress
held on Santiago, Chile, in 1991. It brought together
contributions on various topics, including teaching, health care
and bioethics, among others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The texts from the second congress,<sup>22</sup> which was
held in C&oacute;rdoba, Argentina, in 1993, were published in
1994. This event was marked by a change in the topics presented,
which consisted of qualitative studies and macro-analyses on
health policies, thus showing that the qualitative and
quantitative methodologies were drawing closer together.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1994, a meeting of the International Forum for Social
Sciences and Health (IFSSH) was held. The texts from this were
published by Brice&ntilde;o-Le&oacute;n<sup>5</sup> (1999), with
theoretical and methodological backup, perspectives of the
disciplines within the alliance between the social sciences and
health, and bringing information from Mexico, Venezuela, Peru,
Guatemala, Paraguay, Brazil, Jamaica and Cuba. These texts
analyze the relationships between psychology and mental health;
transmittable diseases; and social participation and
exclusion</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third congress, which was held in 1995 in Atibaia, Brazil,
brought together production on the following topics (some of them
had had little previous representation): ethics and reproductive
health; gender and women's health; the man's role in reproductive
health; integration of the work between social scientists and
other health professionals; domestic violence; environmental
questions; and the role of the media within health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1990s, the contribution of Brazilian authors resulted
from the Workshop on Social Sciences within Health, which was
held in Rio de Janeiro in 1995. Canesqui<sup>9</sup> (1995)
brought this material together in a compilation that highlighted
two strands: the place of social sciences within the field of
health, especially their institutionalization; and
theoretical-methodological questions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fourth congress was held in Coyooc. Mexico, in 1997, and
its studies were published in 1999.<sup>7</sup> The five main
strands showed the paths that the social sciences were taking at
the end of that decade: methodology and ethics in research;
social inequality; gender relations and health policies in the
context of social policies; health care and practical
alternatives; and health and disease problems such as AIDS,
aging, medications, violence and workers' health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fifth congress was held in 1999, on Isla Margarita,
Venezuela, with the publication of the compilation of the studies
in 2000.<sup>6</sup> Previous topics were reinforced, and the
researchers' interest centered on equality and the dilemmas of
health research, in the light of observed great inequalities:
around the world, 90% of the resources were being allocated for
investigating problems that affected 10% of the population. The
introductory texts marked out and developed the topic of health
as a question that was very characteristic of that moment, to
which contributions were made by poverty, lifestyles of abundance
and scarcity, and violence. Analytical and critical studies on
medical rationales and alternative practices, and also the
subjective prospects for health, marked the production at this
end of the century.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2003, the publication resulting from the Second Brazilian
Congress on Social Sciences within Health,<sup>18</sup> which had
been held in S&atilde;o Paulo in 1999, became the paradigm for
that moment. Through mapping out the texts, the organizers
signaled that the social sciences within the field of health
could be characterized from a perspective that indicated an
eclectic panorama. Special emphasis was given to two important
questions: society's rethinking in terms of exclusion and
inclusion, and the tensions between the global and local
dynamics. With regard to health, the importance of the historical
and intellectual traditions of the social sciences was
highlighted, as was also the presence of analyses that oscillate
between macro and micro perspectives. Thus, the organization of
topics and methodological diversity opened the field to the
relationships between culture and subjectivity, in the search for
headings within health. Studies illustrated the analyses on the
inequalities within health; the social-historical perspective
present; public and private relationships; solidarity as an
organizing element for social relations within health; and the
erosion of quality of life by violence and work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within a scenario in which old social, economic and sanitary
problems continue to be present, in association with new
challenges such as the aging of the population, the chronic
nature of diseases and a quality of life that is increasingly
deteriorating within urban spaces, the social sciences are
entering the twenty-first century thinking about their role as
critical analysts of situations, through methodologies that are
better drawn up, especially with regard to qualitative research,
but without abandoning quantitative research.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The material from 
  the sixth Latin American Congress on Social Sciences within Health, which was 
  held in Santa Clara, Peru, in 2001,<sup>8</sup> presented a mass of topics divided 
  into 12 large groups: health; citizenship and rights; social movements and health; 
  masculinity and gender perspectives within health; sexual identity, differences 
  and citizenship; AIDS &#150; health/disease, vulnerability and agency; violence, 
  gender and health; mental health and structural violence; ethnomedical models, 
  traditional medicine and practical alternative; investigation methods; new contributions; 
  bioethics; reform, economics and globalization; and the relationship between 
  social sciences and public health in the light of the challenges of exclusion. 
  As can be seen, the agenda has become broader as new topics and players have 
  entered the debate and, at the same time, new theoretical and methodological 
  challenges have arisen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The questions signaled earlier were consolidated at the
seventh congress, which was held in Angra dos Reis, Brazil, in
2003. The social sciences have, through reaching full maturity,
opened up to the challenges of incorporating into their
discussion new fields of knowledge within the humanities that
have been in dialog with the social sciences for a long time.
Thus, the textbook produced from this congress rightly received
the title "Cr&iacute;ticas e atuantes: ci&ecirc;ncias sociais e
humanas em sa&uacute;de na Am&eacute;rica Latina" (Critics and
players: social sciences within health in Latin
America).<sup>26</sup> The book reflects the state of the art
within this field, by means of theoretical approaches and
approaches through the disciplines regarding anthropological,
historical, educational, informational and communication
questions. The book also brings analyses of health policies and
State reforms, and studies on social problems with an impact on
health. These studies portray the development and improvement of
the field in the incessant search for updating the debate on
health, without losing the vocation for science.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2003, reflecting the power of the field in Latin America,
the journal <i>Revista Ci&ecirc;ncia e Sa&uacute;de
Coletiva</i><sup>13</sup> organized a thematic issue dedicated to
the social sciences. It was organized by Nunes, 20 years after
the Cuenca Seminar, and this publication reflected on how this
field conceptualized health questions, by seeking to describe,
comprehend and interpret them and thus to find secure grounds in
the theories of the social sciences. The texts dealt with the
relationships between State and society, the construction of this
field in the United States, England and France, and specific
topics. Among the topics that stand out are the discussions on
the relationship between social sciences and epidemiology; the
situation regarding anthropological research in Brazil;
environmental problems; relationships between social sciences,
communication and health; healthcare/disease; teaching;
institutional analysis; and scientific production from the social
science institutes. This study has redeemed the attempts that in
the 1980s sought to present and analyze a field of knowledge that
had become indispensable for the field of health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL COMMENTS</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data presented show that, over the years, a representative
field of scientific activities has been formed, in which the
social sciences have taken up the topic of health. The production
from this has experienced influences from the social, political
and institutional situations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It has been seen that the field presents a great variety of
topics, to which new topics have been added, such as medical
rationales, gender relations, the specificity of studies in the
field of health policies, historical-social studies on diseases,
and the sociological perspective on health assessment studies.
Added to this is the importance that is being given to studies of
epistemological nature.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to this observation, it is perceived that there is
an open field for studies on scientific construction in the field
of social sciences in health. This is being accomplished by means
of studies that have sought grounding in the formulations of the
sociology, history and philosophy of science. Through this,
deeper analysis of the scientific production beyond solely
quantitative data is allowed.</font></p>
