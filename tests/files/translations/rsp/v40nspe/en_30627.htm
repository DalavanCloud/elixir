<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a contradiction between the perceptions held by
different sectors of the Establishment with regard to the
questions of hunger and nutrition in Brazil. On the one hand, the
flagship of the present Brazilian government's social policy is
the "Fome Zero" program. This program is based on the notion that
the condition of hunger is socially relevant in this country. On
the other hand, the scientific community in the field of
nutrition has, through epidemiological studies, highlighted
obesity as one of the most serious public health problems in
Brazil. The reason why the public perception is dissociated from
the production of knowledge on this subject has old roots that
are related to the difficulties in institutionalizing science in
Brazil. This has been reflected in a relative lack of legitimacy
for scientific discourse. The new factor in this situation is the
attainment of greater international visibility by the scientific
community in nutritional de epidemiology. The future of the
practical application of the results from nutritional
epidemiology research in Brazil depends on the dynamics of the
political agenda regarding hunger and nutrition, and of the
sectors associated with this. The objective of this study was to
explore this situation by means of analyzing scientometric data
on the scientific production, historical data and documents
relating to discourse about hunger.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a discrepancy between the perception of different
sectors of the Establishment regarding the subject of hunger and
nutrition in Brazil. On the one hand, the cornerstone of the
present Brazilian government's social policy is the "<i>Fome
Zero</i>" program. This program is based on the concept that the
condition of hunger in the country is socially relevant. On the
other hand, the scientific community in the field of nutritional
epidemiology has been pointing towards obesity as one of the most
serious public health problems in Brazil, even among the poorer
strata of the population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reason why the perception of the public authorities, as
substantiated in the implementation of the <i>Fome Zero</i>, is
dissociated from the production of knowledge on the subject has
old roots. Historically, the Brazilian scientific community
fought to conquer its space in society. Over the course of this
process, it ended up encapsulated: isolated from the productive
sector and public demands.<sup>4,5,18</sup> The lack of
legitimacy of scientific discourse on hunger and obesity in
Brazil may partially reflect a chronic condition of Brazilian
science.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new factor in this situation is the gaining of wider
international visibility by the scientific community in the field
of nutritional epidemiology. This has resulted in a credibility
shock: the discourse of a scientific community strengthened by
indicators of merit and recognition confronting the
presuppositions of public policies from a government strongly
backed up by institutionalized sectors, such as public bodies and
universities, in the fields of both social and human
sciences.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This confrontation has serious implications regarding the
relevance, space and role of science in Brazilian society, such
as if decision-makers within the public sphere have been making
their decisions without the support of the corresponding
scientific information. If the role of the information produced
is to provide backing for decisions on public policies, it is
necessary to explain this act of deliberately disregarding
information that already exists.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of the present paper was to explore the
phenomenon of this confrontation by means of analyzing
scientometric data on Brazilian scientific production, historical
data and documents regarding the subject of hunger. From this,
the implications of this discourse are further discussed from the
point of view of the applicability of scientific knowledge for
establishing public policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Scientific information for decision making</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is an old and diversified discussion among science
scholars regarding the destination of products from scientific
activity beyond the walls of their own community. Inside this
community, knowledge moves around in a relatively self-referenced
manner: it is produced according to thinking styles or
intellectual priorities that are stipulated by an organized and
hierarchical group of specialists. Its rhetoric relates to
controversies that orchestrate the power relationships among
them, and the assessed product legitimates the
producers.<sup>6,10,12</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the scientific knowledge interacts with practices
that are external to the scientific community. It can be said
that scientific production is consumed in different manners by
different consumers that will make different social uses of it.
The use made by players outside the community varies greatly, as
does the origin of this transference of scientific products to
external consumers. This phenomenon is related to old questions
regarding the utility and applicability of knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gibbons et al<sup>8</sup> (1994) called the knowledge produced
according to the self-referenced logic detailed above "Mode 1"
production, typical of capitalism prior to the Second World War.
"Mode 2" would correspond to a way of producing knowledge in
which the internal logic of each discipline would have less power
for directing study objectives, strategies and methodologies,
since the production would be more diversified with regard to the
institution, the players involved and the interests in question.
The production of this knowledge would imply greater feedback for
the players outside the community (social accountability), i.e.
the production in an "application context", in which the solution
for a given practical problem would dictate the theoretical and
methodological strategies. Other authors have affirmed that these
two modes have always existed (Fuller,<sup>7</sup> 1995).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present paper, these modes have been considered to be
different aspects of scientific production, in which the
proportional weights of self-referenced emphasis or conditioning
factors relating to demands and extra-scientific interests vary
according to the case. No knowledge produced is restricted to the
community or disregards culture and values to be generated and
consumed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This phenomenon divides the questions regarding the
consumption of scientific knowledge between industrial innovation
(science push/market pull) and public demand. Both questions
place the problem within the configurations of the investigation
program and the conditions of knowledge production itself,
influenced by interests other than those internal to the
scientific community.<sup>17</sup> There is another category of
questions that is related to the previous ones and evident in the
case of <i>Fome Zero</i>. Before asking how far the Brazilian
community of nutritional epidemiologists has been guided by the
demands of public interest, it is necessary to ask how much the
social players involved in the production of public health
policies have made use of scientific knowledge in order to make
decisions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most general question relates to the extent to which, in a
rational and bureaucratic society, the decision-makers within the
public sphere and the interest groups with power to condition
public policies are obliged to found such decisions on an
empirical basis supported by the scientific community.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question is: why was it possible, in Brazil, to create a
public policy against a nonexistent epidemiological phenomenon,
hunger?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The answer to this 
  question requires an analysis from the points of view of those who produce and 
  disseminate &#150; the scientific community &#150; and of those who make use 
  of the scientific information to make decisions. From the point of view of those 
  who produce, the literature on the history and sociology of Brazilian science 
  suggests, as explanations, its historical isolation and the still incomplete 
  creation of a social space for science.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An example in the history of Brazilian science of a situation
where the information needed for decision-making was available
but was not used, relates to the eradication of Chagas' disease.
The disease was discovered in 1909, and in 1912 there was already
enough information for adopting eradication measures. However, an
institutional program was proposed only in 1985, when the
Brazilian specialists achieved space within the government.
Within a few years, the transmission of this disease was
practically eliminated in Brazil and in the whole Southern Cone
(Coutinho &amp; Dias,<sup>3</sup> 1999). Seventy-three years were
needed for the information made available by the scientific
community to be effectively put into use with the practical aim
of creating a health policy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the point of view of those taking up the scientific
information, the various interest groups participating in the
creation and adoption of a certain public policy manipulate this
information according to their needs, by adulterating it or not
considering it at all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One example of 
  this phenomenon is the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are dedicated 
  to programs for attending to children living in the streets. Many of them use 
  figures of the order of several million children living in the streets. Schwartzman<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> 
  (1994), while president of the <i>Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat&iacute;stica</i> 
  (IBGE - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), warned about the risk 
  of confounding "poor child" with "homeless child", since the data did not support 
  those numbers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, even in modern societies, the extent to which technical
information assessed by a legitimate group of specialists has to
be resorted to for decision-making varies greatly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Epidemiology of hunger in Brazil</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Monteiro,<sup>13,14</sup> chronic hunger of
epidemiological importance is a chronic energy deficiency, and
this is one of the types of malnutrition. This means that the
total caloric value of food in the individual's diet is less than
the daily caloric consumption, independent of the macro and
micronutritional composition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conventionally, the presence of hunger is measured by counting
the number of adults with a body mass index (BMI) of less than
18.5kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The rationale for adopting this indicator
is that energy deficiency in adults leads to weight loss.
Therefore, by identifying the percentage of adult individuals
with low weight in a population, a very precise idea about the
extent of hunger in that country or region can be obtained.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), levels of
low-weight adults of less than 3% characterize countries where
there is no hunger; between 5 and 9%, low prevalence of hunger
(thereby suggesting a need for monitoring measures); between 10
and 19%, moderate prevalence of hunger; between 20-29%, high
prevalence; and over 40% characterizes very high prevalence of
hunger, <i>sensu strictu</i> (WHO,<sup>19</sup> 1995).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The studies by Monteiro<sup>14</sup> showed that the hunger
problem is of small extent in Brazil. In 1996-1997, the
percentage of low-weight adults was 4.9% in the Northeast and
Southeast. In the rural Northeast, a percentage of 7.1% was
identified, which would justify monitoring it. A national survey
by the IBGE in 2002-2003 confirmed that the problem was almost
under control throughout country (IBGE,<sup>9</sup> 2004).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For comparison purposes, the mean level of low-weight adults
in Mexico is 9%, in Haiti around 20%, in Ethiopia around 40% and
in India it reaches 50% of the population.<sup>14</sup> In a
historical follow-up of indicators of the nutritional condition
of the female population in Brazil, Monteiro et al<sup>15</sup>
(2004) described the nutrition transition in this country.
According to these authors, as in other countries, Brazil has
been going through profound changes in the nutritional profile of
its population over the last quarter century. The trends observed
point towards a reduction in the importance of low weight and
increased relevance of overweight, particularly in low-income
populations. The women with BMI=18.5kg/m<sup>2</sup> (low weight)
and =30kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese) among the poorest and richest 25%
in 1975, 1989 and 1997 were identified. The prevalence of low
weight among the poorest went down from 17.1% to 9.5% between
1975 and 1997, while the prevalence of obese women in the same
group went up from 4.7% to 12.6%. In the female population as a
whole, the prevalence of low weight in the most recent survey was
6%, while obesity rated 12.7%.<sup>15</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other studies from the same group<sup>16</sup> indicate that
the increase in obesity is of great importance in most developing
countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The studies described aforementioned do not support any public
policy that presupposes the predominance of hunger, <i>strictu
sensu</i>, i.e. chronic energy deficiency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The public perception of hunger and the Zero Hunger
program</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the official 
  document on the Government's Food Security Policy, the following points are 
  highlighted: "We need to beat hunger, misery and social exclusion. Our war is 
  not to kill anyone &#150; it is to save lives"; and "Today, almost one-third 
  of the Brazilian population goes hungry".<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Fome Zero</i> 
  is the federal government's main social program and, up to the end of 2005, 
  it had spent around R$27 billions.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> 
  The program includes 31 actions and subprograms, and the main one is the so-called 
  "<i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>", which was created in 2004 and accounts for more 
  than 50% of the budget. Data from the program assume that 58.6% of poor families 
  in the country are being attended by the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The program was 
  created in 2001,<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a> but its 
  origins are much older than this. The question of hunger in Brazil took on a 
  political character prior to a scientific one. This is reflected in the permanence 
  of the subject among economists and social scientists in the present scientific 
  literature. The work by Castro<sup>2</sup> (1946), "Geografia da fome" (Geography 
  of hunger), may be considered to be the starting point for the discourse regarding 
  hunger. This author is often cited by academic sectors involved in intellectual 
  production regarding hunger, although this discourse has, from an institutional 
  point of view, followed a pathway that is more political than scientific. Castro 
  was president of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) between 1952 and 
  1956.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conceived to promote food and nutritional security for Brazil,
the <i>Fome Zero</i> program had two strands: one intellectual,
the other regarding mobilization. Since the 1980s, there have
been campaigns related to fighting hunger that have mobilized
broad sectors of society in actions for donation and distribution
of food. In 1993, the National Council for Food Security was
created, which still exists today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is evidence that the intellectuals involved in creating
the program had knowledge of the epidemiological studies on
hunger in Brazil. The decision to ignore this literature was
justified by downgrading its intellectual value on the basis of
other measurements of hunger.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to WHO,<sup>19</sup> 
  BMI of less than 18.5kg/m<sup>2</sup> is the most appropriate way of assessing 
  the incidence of hunger, understood as chronic energy deficiency. On the other 
  hand, the authors of the program considered that BMI below this reference level 
  reflected the continuous effect of hunger in such individuals, but possibly 
  did not include vulnerable people who ate irregularly without suffering weight 
  variations.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are two other ways of obtaining statistical data on
hunger within a given geographical area. The indirect method,
which is used by many researchers and was adopted by the
technical experts of the <i>Fome Zero</i> project, consists of
calculating the per capita monetary cost of the intake of a
certain quantity of food that is the minimum for survival, and
comparing this figure with the individuals' income. Income below
this cost would indicate a deficit, thus placing these
individuals in a situation of risk.<sup>1</sup> Therefore, the
mean weighted poverty line for Brazil (R$71.53 per person)
indicates the existence of 46 million people with an mean
available income of R$39.11, or 9.9 million families (with an
average of 4.7 persons) with an income of R$183.81. It can be
said that the people in these families do not have enough income
to ensure their food security.<sup>1</sup> This is the origin of
the cabalistic number of 40 million hungry persons, and not the
number of low-weight individuals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This concept has 
  been maintained throughout the stages of implementing the program, according 
  to publications gathered from the official site of <i>Fome Zero</i>, from 2002 
  to 2006. These papers reflect the perception of those speaking for and defending 
  the program in their communications with society. These papers are classified 
  according to topics: hunger, food security, <i>Fome Zero</i> program, <i>Bolsa 
  Fam&iacute;lia</i> program and poverty (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It can be seen that, in 2006, there were no more papers
published on hunger, and the focus of attention was turned
towards the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> subprogram.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The papers listed on the site are predominantly signed by
institutional figures and represent the way in which the
government sees itself publicly portrayed by society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Epidemiology of obesity in Brazil</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Between 1998 and 2002, the scientific production on the
epidemiology of obesity increased from 1.1% to 1.5%
(Landi,<sup>11</sup> 2005).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30627t2.gif">Table

  of S&atilde;o Paulo Research Foundation), shows the percentages of scientific 
  publication in Brazil and in other countries (Landi,<sup>11</sup> 2005).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To examine the profile of scientific production in the field
of nutritional epidemiology, and particularly on obesity in
Brazil, which is regarded as a relevant problem by the scientific
community, a bibliographic search was carried out in ISI/Thomson
Scientific database. The search strategy included the term
"Brazil" in the address field of at least one of the authors, in
order to characterize the Brazilian production, and the term
"obesity" in the subject field.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In relation to the topic of obesity within the field of
nutritional epidemiology, Brazil represents 2.3% of the world
production and occupies twelfth place in production. This
participation qualifies the field as among those with the
greatest visibility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian scientific 
  production on obesity is recent in comparison to the world production, as seen 
  in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. It started in the 1980s, and underwent a significant 
  increase from the year 2000 onwards. The reason why the curve trend for Brazil 
  is out of step with the international trend is related, on the one hand, on 
  the internationalization of the Brazilian scientific community. On the other 
  hand, from the 1980s onwards, the nutritional transition pointed towards obesity 
  as an epidemiological phenomenon of general reach in Brazil.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v40nspe/30627f2.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The scientific 
  production on this subject is concentrated in a few institutions: <i>Universidade 
  de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> and <i>Universidade Federal de S&atilde;o Paulo</i> 
  account for 34.1% of all publications over the period 2000-2004. The remaining 
  production is divided among 97 other institutions (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Final considerations</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monteiro<sup>14</sup> (2003) considered that part of this
problem comes from an inappropriate equivalence made between
poverty, malnutrition and hunger by the interlocutors of the
public debate. This would derive from the lack of knowledge of or
disregard for data that has been produced by the IBGE since the
1970s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of the term "hunger" within an inappropriate
conceptualization in the <i>Fome Zero</i> documents shows that
the problem goes beyond this inappropriate equivalence. In the
analysis of official texts, it became clear that the writers knew
of the definitions adopted by WHO and decided to ignore them,
opting for indirect measurements for hunger. If there are not
more than 40 million low-weight individuals in Brazil, this is
because, even though the income measurement points towards
insufficient food purchasing power, these people are obtaining
food somehow. It can be understood that the authors of the
program took the political nature of popular mobilization
regarding hunger as the basis for the program for two reasons:
the emotional appeal to empathy and urgency. To say that 40
million Brazilians are living in a state of chronic hunger is to
say that one in every four Brazilians is in need of immediate
strong emergency action in order ensure their survival.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To produce this effect of mobilization against catastrophe, it
was necessary to ignore the scientific evidence that was
inconvenient from the point of view of political interests.
However, scientific knowledge can provide the basis for
decision-making regarding the food situation in this country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This knowledge, which is more directly applicable, is being
produced by a scientific community with relatively high
international visibility in relation to the national production.
This is a phenomenon that brings together desirable
characteristics in terms of scientific excellence and
applicability. If the application of this scientific knowledge of
direct applicability and high credibility becomes obstructed
through the policies that are formulated, the whole process of
confirmation of this space for Brazilian science will be
jeopardized, as observed in the questions of hunger and obesity.
The future for the practical application of research results from
nutritional epidemiology in Brazil depends on the dynamics of the
political agendas regarding hunger and nutrition, and the
dynamics of sectors related to these agendas.</font></p>
